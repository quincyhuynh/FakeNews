       "   'text': '30 April, 2017 Motor vehicles and particulate pollution The article below appeared under the heading \"Toxic diesel particles penetrate right through to the heart, scientists warn\". But the research concerned showed no such thing. The article is part of a decades-long Greenie campaign to demonize motor vehicles by showing that they are harmful to health. And there have been countless studies showing that people who live beside busy roads do have more illness of various sorts. It has been known for decades that that proves nothing but the studies keep rolling out. It proves nothing because it is mostly poor people who live beside busy roads. Richer people can afford more leafy environments. And the poor have more illness in general -- for reasons that I will glide over -- so the illnesses shown by road studies could well be poverty effects, not pollution effects. So to the study below: It was an experiment using particles of gold so was from the beginning inconclusive -- unless motor vehicles start spewing out gold for their tailpipes. And even using gold no health effects were shown. All that was shown was that nanoparticles can be very penetrative in the body, which we already knew. There is a whole literature on the possible effects of nanoparticles too. So if motor vehicle emissions cause ill-health we are still waiting on a study to show that. No doubt at some level they do cause harm but where is the cutoff? Do such emissions cause harm in normal life? There is a reason why they probably do not. We in fact breathe in all sorts of junk every day. But our bodies are used to that and normally cope with it seamlessly. They even cope with all the poisons in tobacco smoke pretty well. There are a lot of Jewish centenarians in NYC and about a third of them smoke. So the only reasonable question about motor emissions is whether or not they increase the disease burden beyond the already low level that other atmospheric pollutants inflict? Considering what we cope with already, it seems unlikely. And note that even mesothelioma, a disease that stems from heavy exposure to asbestos fibres, is normally not fatal or even apparent until the patient is in his 60s. Asbestos fibres are quite large particles compared with what we have been talking about here but even they are very slow to inflict harm. If the body tolerates even asbestos fibres relatively well, why should we believe that much smaller particles are not well tolerated? Toxic particles from diesel vehicles can work their way through the lungs and into the bloodstream, raising the risk of heart attacks and strokes, researchers have proved for the first time. The nanoparticles, which cannot be traced by Government measuring equipment, stay in the body for months and tend to build up in areas that are most prone to disease. Scientists have long known that air pollution is bad for the lungs, but until now they did not know whether exhaust particles were able to penetrate further into the body. A team at Edinburgh University used harmless gold nanoparticles, at an equivalent size to diesel, in a human experiment that simulated cycling through a city. By looking at surgically removed body samples they found that the gold had accumulated in the fatty areas inside blood vessels that are responsible for heart attack and strokes. This tallies with previous research showing that cardiovascular disease, of which stroke is a form, accounts for 80 per cent of the roughly 50,000 premature deaths from air pollution each year in the UK. The scientists say the findings are particularly worrying as officials only have the capacity to measure the overall volume of pollution particles in the air, rather than their number. While the overall volume of pollution has been falling, they say the number of the most toxic tiny particles able to get deep inside the body is on the rise. Dr Nicholas Mills, Professor of Cardiology at Edinburgh and one of the study‚Äôs co-authors, said: ‚ÄúWe have always suspected that nanoparticles in the air that we breath could escape from the lung and enter the body, but until now there was no proof. ‚ÄúThese findings are of wide importance for human health, and we must now focus our attention on reducing emissions and exposure to airborne nanoparticles.‚Äù While petrol particles are also able to penetrate the lungs, a petrol engine will throw out roughly 50 times fewer particles than a diesel engine of equivalent size, the researchers said. The particles are also capable of penetrating the masks worn by some cyclists to avoid pollution. Dr Mark Miller, who led the Edinburgh study, said: ‚ÄúIt is striking that particles in the air we breathe can get into our blood where they can be carried to different organs of the body. ‚ÄúOnly a very small proportion of inhaled particles will do this, however, if reactive particles like those in air pollution then reach susceptible areas of the body then even this small number of particles might have serious consequences.‚Äù It is possible to fit filters onto diesel vehicles to reduce the number of particles they emit, however these can make cars and lorries inefficient, burning more fuel overall, as well as more expensive. The research team said a mandatory imposition of filters on all vehicles was premature. SOURCE \\nClimate Bullies Take to the Streets for ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Climate March‚Äô Most Americans are unaware of the vicious campaign waged by climate activists against people who do not recite the strictest tenets of the manmade-climate-change creed. The People‚Äôs Climate March is Saturday, April 29, and it will be the third iteration of an anti-Trump rally just this month. (April has been busy for the perpetually agitated.) It is a day when lefties accomplish little more than exposing their planet-sized hypocrisy on the environment: Eco-celebs such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo will walk arm-in-arm to lament the Earth‚Äôs destruction by greedy fossil-fuel companies, and then they will jet off to their next fossil-fuel-powered movie set to make millions. Jerry Brown, Andrew Cuomo, and other politicians will lecture us about the dangers of CO2 as they close zero-emission nuclear plants in their own states. Millennials will snap selfies on cellphones that operate off an electric grid powered by natural gas made abundantly available by the fracking they will protest. According to its website, here is the point of the People‚Äôs Climate March: On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, we will be in the streets of Washington D.C. to show the world and our leaders that we will resist attacks on our people, our communities and our planet. Now set aside for a moment the comical idea that angry anti-Trumpers, who have been in attack mode since November 8, are themselves under attack. This statement reveals the height of hypocrisy from the climate crowd; they are the bullies attacking anyone who dares to question climate science or who doubts whether human activity is causing climate change. Most Americans are unaware of the vicious campaign ‚Äî including character assassination, political witch-hunts, and media propaganda ‚Äî waged by climate activists against people who do not recite the strictest tenets of the manmade-climate-change creed. When the New York Times announced a few weeks ago that it had hired Bret Stephens, a former Wall Street Journal columnist, the climate cult went insane. (Stephens has been critical of climate-change dogma.) Joe Romm, the editor of Climate Progress , and others demanded that the Times fire Stephens. Hundreds of people threatened to cancel their subscriptions to protest the hiring of a so-called climate denier, including leading climate scientist Ken Caldeira who accused Stephens of having a ‚Äúreckless disregard for well-established scientific facts.‚Äù Michael Mann, a climate scientist from Penn State University and keynote speaker at the March for Science, tweeted this: ‚ÄúIt should trouble everyone in the scientific community that the primary response of its leading voices when they encounter a voice they don‚Äôt like is to try to get that person fired from their job. That is doesn‚Äôt trouble anyone very much says something,‚Äù wrote Roger Pielke, Jr. in a blog post this month. Pielke is a scientist who concluded a decade ago that climate change was not contributing to more extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, a finding that was eventually supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By exposing this flaw in climate science, Pielke has since been targeted by powerful climate interests determined to destroy his career and reputation. He has been called a climate denier, even though he believes human activity is causing climate change and he supports a carbon tax. President Obama‚Äôs top science adviser, John Holdren, wrote a lengthy missive against Pielke, which prompted one Democratic congressman to call for an investigation into Pielke‚Äôs research (he is a professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder). The coercion was so great that Pielke left the field of climate science a few years ago. He‚Äôs back in the fray now, after some climate bullies, including Mann, who is suing National Review for alleged defamation, attacked Pielke for his testimony on Capitol Hill last month on climate science. Pielke will start posting a monthly blog about climate issues, mostly to fight back against the campaign of intimidation by climate activists and the complicity of the scientific establishment. ‚ÄúThe science community not only allows this bullying, they applaud it. And the power brokers endorse it. There are no ordinary checks and balances in the profession,‚Äù Pielke told me. ‚ÄúThere is a view among climate activists that if they can get everyone to believe the same thing, then the right policies will take place. It gives these people political standing.‚Äù And that is what most terrifies the climate tribe: the loss of political power and policymaking influence, as well as the government funding that goes with it. In a recent interview, Steven Koonin, a former undersecretary in Obama‚Äôs Energy Department and now the director of NYU‚Äôs Center for Urban Science and Progress, said scientists are fearful of reprisals if they hold a different view of climate change: ‚ÄúIf you get scientists in a room together, it‚Äôs a vibrant, alive science. But somehow that gets muted, if not suppressed, when you get out into the policy-making discussions,‚Äù Koonin said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to get into the club, so to speak, if you‚Äôre a contrarian. You might see your money cut off, but even more significantly, you‚Äôll see opprobrium from your peers. If you speak up, you can be in big trouble.‚Äù Or even threatened with violence. After the March for Science this past Saturday, shots were fired at the office of John Christy, a climate scientist at the University of Alabama, Hunstville, and a well-known climate-change skeptic. Christy‚Äôs colleague, Roy Spencer, reported the shooting on social media on Monday: ‚ÄúWhen some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way. Maybe the ‚ÄòMarch for Science‚Äô should have been called the ‚ÄòMarch to Silence.‚Äô‚Äù This is the kind of thuggery climate leaders promote so they can keep their agenda intact. They play the victim by insisting that the Trump administration and Republicans are trying to oppress them, but they are the perpetrators, intimidating and coercing anyone who dares to defy them. Contrary to what they say, it‚Äôs about silence, not science. SOURCE \\nWhy the People‚Äôs Climate March Is a Farce After watching the March for Science, we now need a March for Sanity. But that‚Äôll have to wait because this weekend is the People‚Äôs Climate March, another opportunity for left-wing agitators to show off their ignorance on poster-sized tablets preaching the global-warming gospel. It‚Äôs unsurprising: Over the past eight years, we‚Äôve heard nothing but alarmist rhetoric from the climactivist-in-chief, Barack Obama, and his PR department, the mainstream media. The climate march‚Äôs website calls itself part of ‚Äúthe resistance‚Äù that prevented President Trump from repealing Obamacare and also ‚Äústymied his despicable Muslim ban.‚Äù And organizers say they will do the ‚Äúsame thing to his attacks on our climate, our air, and our water.‚Äù How Mr. Trump was attacking the environment is unclear, since our air and water have never been cleaner. Everyone has a right to protest and march peaceably. But using factoids from an Al Gore or Leo DiCaprio movie is something that most climatologists would find embarrassing. What‚Äôs becoming clear is that these marches aren‚Äôt about the climate but more about preventing Obama-era regulations from being rolled back. Activists don‚Äôt want to prevent a climate catastrophe; they want to force mankind to stop using fossil fuels by pressuring political leaders. That‚Äôs why the marches began under Obama‚Äôs tenure; organizations want to ‚Äúkeep it in the ground‚Äù and prevent fuel transport across the country through safe, efficient pipelines. They want the rest of us to accept their fantastical claims that carbon dioxide is a control knob for the planet‚Äôs climate. The next time a warmist starts blathering on about carbon pollution, hand him a glass of tonic water and say ‚ÄúHere, have some carbon pollution.‚Äù Yes, that seltzer water contains plenty of the dreaded carbon dioxide. And because the media have warned of ‚Äúcarbon pollution‚Äù so often, the public now confuses CO2 with perceived soot emissions. But America‚Äôs modern coal-fired power plants use advanced scrubbers to remove mercury, nitrous oxide, sulfates, and particulate matter, leaving only a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide to rise up the ‚Äúsmokestack.‚Äù Of course, CO2 is also a key nutrient for all plant life and, according to NASA, is making the Earth greener. So, let‚Äôs start with the ‚Äúhottest year ever‚Äù claims. Why do the media refuse to show how much warmer 2016 was than 2015? And why do the media instead show melting icebergs, hapless penguins, and calving glaciers when discussing this crucial data point? According to the available satellite datasets, 2016 was warmer than 2015 by only 0.04 degrees. The margin of error is 0.1 degrees, meaning it‚Äôs statistically insignificant. What we can say is that since we left the Little Ice Age in 1850, the Earth has warmed by one degree Celsius. We‚Äôll survive. Pundits also refuse to tell their readers what drove the warming of the past two years: a particularly strong, naturally occurring El Ni√±o that lasted from 2015 to 2016. El Ni√±o events form during profound shifts in Pacific Ocean convection, with sea surface temperatures becoming warmer than normal for more than three consecutive months. Such powerful reversals of prevailing circulation can affect weather worldwide for many months at a time. As potent as the recent El Ni√±o was, temperatures are now plummeting back to previous levels, according to both satellite and weather balloon data. Unfortunately, stationary land and sea measuring stations have diverged from satellite scans. NASA has always referred to satellite temperature measurements as the \"gold standard\" ‚Äî until they stopped showing net warming after 1998. But these satellite measurements are particularly important because there are no adequate temperature stations located in the tropical forests of South America or much of Africa. Antarctica has a few stations clustered at research stations on one side of the continent, while the Arctic is largely uncovered. Prior to 1980, the United States possessed the most measuring stations of any nation. Most countries across Eurasia didn\\'t bother to measure how warm or cold it was during both World Wars. U.S. data happen to be so robust that most meteorological organizations have integrated America\\'s pre-1980 data. And by incorporating those data, these organizations have also inherited any corruptions or data-tampering in the 20th-century temperature records. That\\'s because \"adjusted\" data sets have allowed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to cool the past in order to demonstrate more dramatic warming during the latter part of the 20th century. In fact, NOAA clumsily erased the nearly 30-year-long cooling period from the \\'40s to the \\'70s and tweaked the 1930s ‚Äî the hottest decade on record ‚Äî to make these years look less dramatic. As meteorologist Joe Bastardi pointed out on Fox News this week, much of the warming over the past 150 years can be directly tied to sunspot activity, oscillating patterns of oceanic warming and cooling, and numerous sub-variables. But climate alarmists treat CO2 as the sole stove knob for changes in temperature and weather. Bastardi notes that, historically, CO2 and temperature have rarely correlated, including Ice Age periods with much higher CO2 levels. Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported former Energy Department Undersecretary Steven Koonin\\'s claim that President Obama\\'s administration manipulated scientific data to sway public opinion. \"What you saw coming out of the press releases about climate data, climate analysis, was, I\\'d say, misleading, sometimes just wrong,\" he said. As an example, Koonin pointed to the National Climate Assessment (NCA) of 2014, which showed an increase in hurricane activity from 1980 as an example of how federal agencies cooked the books. He said the NCA assessment was wrong because, \"What they forgot to tell you, and you don\\'t know until you read all the way into the fine print, is that it actually decreased in the decades before that.\" He\\'s right. According to NOAA\\'s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, there has been no \"detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity.\" And what about the intensity of tropical cyclones/hurricanes? None have gotten worse, according to the data mapped out by climatologist Dr. Ryan N. Maue. Al Gore once warned of a pending hurricane epidemic. But the facts indicate that there has been \"no uptick in the global frequency of tropical storms or hurricanes\" and \"no trend in cyclone energy.\" Koonin said it\\'s a scientist\\'s job \"to put the facts on the table.\" And so, the worst offenders have been NASA and NOAA, with both using their data to politicize science. Koonin sees these agencies\\' actions as problematic because \"public opinion is formed by the data that [come] from those organizations and appear in newspapers.\" And so, a deeper dive into the data reveals a lack of support for the catastrophic global warming narrative. But that won\\'t stop protesters from claiming that America\\'s coastlines are quickly going underwater. Al Gore pointed to Hurricane Sandy\\'s flooding of New York and New Jersey as proof of sea-level rise (and of his predictions). Actually, it was proof of a hurricane\\'s storm surge. Has sea-level rise increased? According to a study published in 2016 in Scientific Reports, it\\'s actually slowed down to two millimeters per year, and \"current altimeter products show the rate of sea-level rise to have decreased from the first to second decades of the altimeter era.\" You can look at coastal photographs from the early 1900s and those from today and see there are minuscule differences, even along rocky coastlines. One prominent study showed the Earth has added more coastline than it\\'s lost. And before you say Miami flooding, the occurrence is caused by a naturally occurring event known as a King\\'s Tide, in which the moon and sun line up to create a higher-than-normal tide. This has been happening since Miami was settled. And because of land subsidence, it\\'s gotten worse (the land is sinking, because altimeters show sea-level rise has actually slowed down.) Have tornadoes increased? According to NOAA\\'s climate-information website, there has been \"little trend in the frequency of the stronger tornadoes over the past 55 years.\" The year 1974 is still the reigning champion and that was during the Great Cooling Scare. Snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere? According to Rutgers University Snow Lab, snow extent has increased. And Al Gore said children wouldn\\'t know what snow was by 2012.... Wildfires? According to the EPA and National Interagency Fire Center, wildfires haven\\'t increased. Ironically, poor forestry management ‚Äî which has emphasized actions to rapidly halt any forest fires ‚Äî has yielded an excess of dry kindling, which has enabled subsequent, larger wildfires. Floods and droughts have not grown in intensity or strength. More people have moved into flood zones and areas once not considered habitable. And such wealthy living has led to larger insurance payouts after catastrophe strikes. But because it\\'s been so long since a large-scale event has occurred, people think it\\'s safe to live in a flood plain or in the wild. Of course, when a massive flood or wildfire occurs, activists blame it on global warming. But the risk is on the occupants, who chose to settle in areas that do indeed face risks. As for stronger storms or extreme weather, not a single government agency can say there has been any uptick in trends because the data don\\'t back it up. Even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\'s most current AR5 report said there have been few instances of extreme weather, which makes it premature to attribute severe weather events to global warming. Everyone has a right to protest and march peaceably. But using factoids from an Al Gore or Leo DiCaprio movie is something that most climatologists would find embarrassing. In science, nothing is ever settled. If it were, we\\'d still think trans fats are no big deal, the Earth is flat, and the sun revolves around the Earth. That\\'s why real scientists cringe at the word consensus, and why politics should be kept as far from the lab as possible. SOURCE \\nShale Crushes Solar The Promethean task of supplying energy to the U.S. economy and the rest of the world involves scales that are truly difficult to visualize. Many options appear to make sense until you crunch the numbers. That‚Äôs why Bill Gates said that people need to bring ‚Äúmath skills to the problem.‚Äù Consider petroleum alone, which accounts for about one-third of global energy use. If the world‚Äôs current oil supply were delivered in a pile of actual barrels, that stack would rise up at a velocity of 1,500 miles per hour and reach the moon‚Äôs orbit in a week ‚Äì and continue at that rate every week for years to come. Meanwhile, solar and wind power are the two most discussed ‚Äúdisruptions‚Äù to our energy supply. It is true that solar/wind costs have gone down dramatically in the past decade. At the same time there‚Äôs a policy revolution in subsidies (more about policies in part 3 of this series) leading to a cumulative $100+ billion in the U.S. for solar/wind. The effect of this combination has been to proliferate solar panels and wind turbines sufficient to drive a nearly 10-fold increase in combined energy supplied from those sources. While that‚Äôs quite remarkable, wind and solar together still supply less than 1.5% of America‚Äôs energy. Fast growth from a small number is like winning $100 in Vegas on a $10 bet. Nice, but not life-changing. To find a ‚Äúradical and pervasive‚Äù change in energy markets we have to look elsewhere. Over the same decade noted above, the amount of energy added to America from shale hydrocarbons was 2,000% greater than the additional supply from solar and wind combined. That actual revolution also happened because of the maturation of new technologies. But, notably, in this case it took place without the stimulus of special subsidies. The scale and velocity of the shale revolution is underappreciated. It is the fastest and biggest addition to world energy supply -- not just hydrocarbons, but all forms of energy -- that has occurred in history. The only time something close to as dramatic has occurred was in the decade following the 1968 opening of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs giant Ghawar oil field. This American transformation has far-reaching implications, not least of which is that the U.S. now exports crude ‚Äì savor the word ‚Äúexports‚Äù ‚Äì at a rate north of 1 million barrels a day. That‚Äôs the highest rate of U.S. crude exports since 1958, by a factor of two, and outstrips the crude exports of five of OPEC‚Äôs members. Four decades of handwringing about import dependencies and serially misguided federal energy policies were upended overnight. Looking to the future, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù forecast (which assumes subsidies continue) see solar and wind output growing three-fold by 2035. EIA‚Äôs optimistic forecast for shale hydrocarbons for the next two decades (still no subsidies of course) has that industry replicating it‚Äôs growth of the past single decade. We‚Äôll suggest, shortly, why that‚Äôs actually a pessimistic forecast. So by 2035, the American energy revolution will still be driven by oil & gas. But the revolution with respect to shale goes far beyond ‚Äòmere‚Äô quantity. In many quarters, the enthusiasm for solar and wind has been animated largely by the notion that these sources democratize energy production. But in fact, wind and solar growth in the past decade is utterly dominated by utility-scale projects, and a Darwinian consolidation of the companies that produce the hardware. There are currently only a few major wind turbine vendors (only one in the U.S.); while a comparably small number (most in China now) of solar panel producers utterly dominate the market. In short, we‚Äôve seen the emergence of ‚Äúbig solar‚Äù and ‚Äúbig wind.‚Äù The shale story has been precisely the opposite. None of the ‚Äúbig oil‚Äù companies, the super-majors, were responsible for creating the new shale industry. The pioneers were all upstarts with names like Continental, Pioneer and Brigham. There are hundreds of shale drillers; more than four dozen relatively unknown companies comprise the top ranks. The majors, of course, have noticed and have started to get into the game, but they will still constitute a small share of that industry for the foreseeable future. The rapid emergence of a new, diverse and broad community of companies in the U.S. shale industry is a classic, American entrepreneurial bootstrap story culminating in a new industry that has truly democratized a huge swath of the energy landscape. And second only to its staggering scale, the single most remarkable and revolutionary feature of the shale ecosystem is, in a word, velocity. It‚Äôs not just the speed with which that industry went from essentially zero to a $100+ billion per year business ‚Äì about which we note: this was a faster and bigger growth in revenues than the contemporaneous rise in smartphone sales in the U.S. It is also the speed with which wells can be drilled. Rather than planning and development that can take not just multiple years but even decades for traditional billion-dollar hydrocarbon projects, each shale well is an individual decision involving nearly a thousand-fold less capital. Those decisions are made in weeks to months. And, critically the wells can be drilled in a week or two. The world has never seen anything like this. The net effect of all this is a collective U.S. shale ecosystem that can respond organically and rapidly to price fluctuations. We‚Äôve already seen the result of this in action. The huge oil price collapse that began in 2014 and lasted until only a few months ago did lead to a pullback in U.S. production, but only about a 10% decline. Now with a modest price rise of the past several months, investments, and drilling and production, have come roaring back and are on track and could reach new record levels this year. But the price collapse ‚Äì a collapse, it bears noting, that was engineered by the Saudis to discipline markets ‚Äì did result in some casualties in the form of bankruptcies and layoffs across the shale domains. Hydrocarbons will continue to be cyclical commodities both from manipulators and natural market dynamics. However, high-speed U.S. shale now becomes a throttle on price rises. What we have learned from this latest price cycle is that the staggeringly large shale system is in fact quite resilient. Just see what happens if you propose that the solar and wind industry be subject to a cyclical and spot pricing system and have to deal with a 60% drop in revenues (as the oil business experienced) without the crutch of semi-permanent pricing and guaranteed off-take. That such a state of affairs would likely deal a deathblow to solar/wind growth is not speculative; it‚Äôs precisely what industry lobbyists tell policymakers on both sides of the aisle every time it is suggested. So while solar/wind advocates ply the halls of Congress and statehouses to preserve access to the people‚Äôs capital, the total amount of capital committed by private entities to the shale fields rose by nearly $40 billion in the first quarter of this year. That money is not coming from captive ratepayers, or government gifts. Shale financing comes from the America‚Äôs broad and distributed financial markets; the world‚Äôs most diverse, liquid, and resilient. Resurgent investment in the shale fields will inevitably -- that‚Äôs the point of the investment -- result in another jump in hydrocarbon output, stimulating America‚Äôs economy, boosting jobs and exports, reducing the trade deficit, and enhancing federal and state treasuries with tax and royalty receipts. There is, after all, a kind of ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù for policymakers. What we have also learned from the cyclical downturn in oil prices is that the technologies involved in shale production are getting better at an amazing rate. The efficacy of shale rigs ‚Äì the amount of physical production per capital dollar spent ‚Äì has been improving by more than 20% per year on average. Put another way; the rigs are getting roughly twice as productive every three years. No other energy technology is improving that quickly. And EIA data shows that rate actually jumped during the last couple of years during the price downturn. But many still believe that a future energy revolution depends solar and wind. Of course those technologies will get far better. But, as is clear from NREL data, both wind and solar are now experiencing a declining rate of improvement as those technologies start to approach their limits in terms of what physics permits. They still improve each year, but now necessarily at a slower rate than in the past. Shale technology is a long way from its physics limits. In fact, the industry is at the beginning of what I‚Äôve earlier termed Shale 2.0. Only now has the industry just begun to embrace the kinds of software and digital solutions that common in other industrial domains. It is no longer speculative to suggest that shale production will soon be boosted, even radically, by digital tools. Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch in March 2017 released their report telegraphically titled, ‚ÄúThe Internet of Oil.‚Äù McKinsey thinks that a digital revolution in oil and gas is coming but is hidden (not for long). Goldman Sachs, and many others, has finally concluded that the shale revolution is structurally permanent. It‚Äôs taken time for the punditocracy to realize that the shale business more closely resembles a manufacturing industry than an ‚Äúextractive‚Äù one, and it‚Äôs about to benefit from Silicon Valley-class tools as a spate of startup tech companies start chasing such a big prize. The bottom line here is important. If you were interested in investing in genuinely revolutionary energy technologies in order to get the biggest bang for the buck, where would you place your bets? This question is relevant for private investors in public companies and increasingly start-ups too. It should also be relevant for policymakers invoking the euphemism of ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù when making bets with taxpayers\\' funds. SOURCE \\nBill Nye\\'s View of Humanity Is Repulsive Bill Nye has some detestable ideas about humanity. This shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone. Many environmental doomsdayers share his totalitarian impulses (he has toyed with the idea of criminalizing speech he dislikes) and soft spot for eugenics. In his Netflix series, ‚ÄúBill Nye Saves the World,‚Äù the former children‚Äôs television host supplies viewers with various trendy notions to adorn his ideological positions with the sheen of science. In the final episode, Nye and his guests contemplate a thorny ‚Äúscientific‚Äù question: How can the state stop people from having ‚Äúextra kids‚Äù? All of this was pretty familiar to me, and not only because the panel sounded like a ChiCom planning meeting. The Nye segment, it turns out, was just a repetition of a 2016 NPR article on overpopulation featuring Travis Rieder. ‚ÄúShould we have policies that penalize people for having extra kids in the developed world?‚Äù asked Reider and others who were pondering the ‚Äúethics of procreation.‚Äù The article is titled ‚ÄúShould We Be Having Kids in the Age of Climate Change?‚Äù In it, Rieder, a philosopher with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, scaremongers a class of college students about The End of Days and the immorality of having children. NPR describes: ‚ÄúThe room is quiet. No one fidgets. Later, a few students say they had no idea the situation was so bad.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a provocative thought,‚Äù Rieder says. ‚ÄúMaybe we should protect our kids by not having them.‚Äù This is provocative in the way a stoner wondering why airplanes don‚Äôt run on hemp is provocative. That‚Äôs because the entire case for capping the number of children rests on assumptions entirely devoid of scientific or historical basis. In 1798, Thomas Malthus wrote that ‚Äúthe power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.‚Äù At that point, there were maybe a billion humans on Earth, so we might forgive him for worrying. In 1800, the life expectancy of the average British citizen ‚Äî Britain then being the leading light of the world ‚Äî was 39 years. Most humans lived in pitiless poverty that is increasingly rare in most parts of the contemporary world. Now, had Nye been around in the early 19th century, he‚Äôd almost surely have been smearing anyone skeptical of the miasma theory of disease. The problem is he lacks imagination; he‚Äôs unable to understand that science is here to help humanity adapt and overcome, not constrict it. Anyway, seven-plus billion people later, extreme poverty was projected to fall below 10 percent for the first time ever in 2015. Most of those gains have been made in the midst of the world‚Äôs largest population explosion. Additionally, it is reported that because of the spread of trade, technological advances and plentiful fossil fuels, fewer people are hungry than ever; fewer die in conflicts over resources; and deaths due to extreme weather have been dramatically declining for a century. Over the past 40 years, our water and air have become cleaner, despite a huge spike in population growth. Some of the Earth‚Äôs richest people live in some of its densest cities. It‚Äôs worth remembering that not only was early progressivism steeped in eugenics but early ‚Äò70s abortion politics was played out in the shadow of Paul Ehrlich‚Äôs population bomb theory. Former Vice President Al Gore has already broached the idea of ‚Äúfertility management.‚Äù Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg mentioned a few years ago, ‚ÄúFrankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don‚Äôt want to have too many of.‚Äù You thought right. Today, abortion is used as a means of exterminating a class of human deemed unworthy of life ‚Äî those with Down syndrome. We live in a world where Ehrlich protege John Holdren ‚Äî who, like his mentor, made a career of offering memorably erroneous predictions (not out of the ordinary for alarmists) ‚Äî was able to become a science czar in the Obama administration. Holdren co-authored a book in late 1970s called ‚ÄúEcoscience: Population, Resources, Environment,‚Äù which waded into theoretical talk about mass sterilizations and forced abortions in an effort to save hundreds of millions from sure death. Nye is a fellow denier of one of the most irrefutable facts about mankind: Human ingenuity overcomes demand. Now, just because something hasn‚Äôt happened yet doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen in the future. But the evidence against Malthusianism is stronger now than it has ever been. And, of course, not everything about human existence can be quantified. This is the point. Talking about humans as if they were a malady that needs to be cured is, at its core, immoral. And listening to a man who has three residences lecture potential parents about their responsibilities to Mother Earth is particularly galling. Although many thousands of incredibly smart and talented people engage in real scientific inquiry and discovery, ‚Äúscience‚Äù is often used as a cudgel to browbeat people into accepting progressive policies. Just look at the coverage of the March for Science last week. The biggest clue that it was nothing more than another political event is that Nye was a speaker. ‚ÄúWe are marching today to remind people everywhere, our lawmakers especially,‚Äù he told the crowd, ‚Äúof the significance of science for our health and prosperity.‚Äù Fortunately, our health and prosperity have blossomed despite the work of Nye and his ideological ancestors.

See here or here 28 April, 2017 Cold Comfort from Ice Core Records of Climate The attempt to defend Warmism below would appear to have solved a problem -- but not the problem they think it solved. The big problem for Warmists is to show synchrony between CO2 levels and temperature. There is so little synchrony in modern times that their only recourse has been to look at paleoclimate -- the climate of many thousands of years ago -- as estimated from ice-cores etc. And when they do that, they appear to find the synchrony they need. CO2 and temperature seem to go up and down roughly in tandem. Skeptics however have always made the point that synchrony is not enough. Following David Hume\\'s notion of causation, you cannot say that X caused Y unless you can show that X PRECEDED Y. And that is where Warmists became unglued. If you looked closely at the paleoclimate record, you found that the causation was the other way around: Warming preceded and hence probably caused CO2 increases, not the other way around. Pesky! A small puzzle was that the warming seemed to precede CO2 rises by a lot. There was a gap of, for example, 800 years between a warming event and a CO2 event. So the CO2 event and the temperature event were not connected at all. They were not part of one continuous process. There seemed in fact to be NO causal relationship between the two variables. Skeptics didn\\'t bother too much about that, though. It was sufficient to show that the sequence required by Warmism did not occur in the record. But that gap did of course burn Warmist up a bit in their rare moments of honesty and some recent research has gone into getting the timing of the various events precisely right. The paleoclimate record is very imprecise so I was always possible that more precise measures of it might not show that pesky gap. And so it seems to have happened. The report below from one of the few Warmist sites that tries to make a scientific case for Warmism lists several studies that essentially eliminate the gap. They find that warming events and CO2 rises were roughly synchronous. And I am going to take that as read. I am not going to take a critical look at the studies concerned. And one of the reasons why I am going to take the \"discovery\" as read is that it makes sense. Warming and CO2 levels SHOULD be pretty synchronous. Warming should cause the oceans to outgas CO2 and thus should produce, more or less immediately, higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. So the new data do nothing to support the Warmist case. Rather than show that CO2 causes warming, they are perfectly compatible with warming causing an atmospheric CO2 rise. Warmists still have no proof anywhere that atmospheric CO2 rises cause terrestrial temperature rises. It is always a bit of a thrill for me to look at posts on \"Skeptical Science\", from which the report below comes. They always seem so sound and solid in their conclusions at first glance. So it is a challenge to spy out the fast and loose bits that their arguments depend on. Usually, they simply omit contrary evidence but on some occasions their fault is simply a fault of logic -- as below When it comes to climate change imagery, the ice core record is kind of a rock star. Graphs of ice core data have become as common as pictures of polar bears and traffic-jammed Los Angeles freeways. And it‚Äôs easy to see why- atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the most important long-lived greenhouse gas, and reconstructions of temperature at the core sites track each other beautifully. As ice cores have been pulled from deeper beneath the surface of polar ice sheets (the longest, in Antarctica, reaching nearly two miles down) the synchronized movement of temperature and greenhouse gases grows more compelling, stretching back more than 800,000 years into the past. In 2006, the ice core record made its big screen debut, with a sizable role in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Al Gore showed two lines, CO2 in red and temperature in blue, moving faithfully together across millennia. Matching peak for peak, dip for dip. The effect was mesmerizing. Suddenly, CO2 skyrockets almost straight up, the result of our modern emissions. The implication for future temperature is clear. Gore characterized the pairing this way: The relationship is very complicated. But there is one relationship that is more powerful than all the others and it is this. When there is more carbon dioxide, the temperature gets warmer, because it traps more heat from the sun inside. As the profile of the ice core record increased, it became the subject of attacks from those seeking to cast doubt on the reality of human-driven climate change. Some dismissed the data because they disagreed with older methods of estimating past levels of CO2, such as fossilized plant stomata. Others claimed that the coring process caused degassing that corrupted the data. Eventually, many contrarians seized upon a line in a paper (Caillon et al., 2003) published a few years before AIT to claim the entire premise of global warming, the whole enchilada, was wrong. They had found, or at least believed they had found, a loophole. An out. And they had it in writing. They claimed that temperature and CO2 might move together, but rather than CO2 driving changes in temperature, changes in temperature actually preceded the changes in CO2. It said so, right there in the paper, ‚Äúthe CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 ¬± 200 years‚Äù. And since effect can‚Äôt precede cause, CO2 can‚Äôt possibly be responsible for changes in planetary temperature. If CO2 ‚Äúlags‚Äù, the contrarians said, it can‚Äôt lead. That big CO2 increase Al Gore showed in his movie? It was nothing to worry about. If CO2 was doing the leading now, temperature wasn‚Äôt going to follow, period. The contrarians were triumphant. This ‚Äúlag not lead‚Äù claim was echoed across blogs and online forums, made its way around the News Corp media empire, and appeared in a widely-watched anti-climate-science polemic The Great Global Warming Swindle. It was even championed by Congressman Joe Barton, former Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It remains one of the most common objections to the reality of man-made climate change to this day. Climate scientists tried, vainly, to rebut this line of attack. They were quick to point out that, just as Gore noted, the CO2-temperature relationship is complicated. Greenhouse gases weren‚Äôt the initial cause of the temperature increases over the ice core record; subtle variations in the Earth‚Äôs position relative to the sun (called Milankovitch cycles) were. These orbitally-driven temperature variations eventually triggered changes in greenhouse gases, which then greatly boosted the initial temperature change. CO2 can be both a cause and a response- a forcing and a feedback, in the vernacular of climate science- depending on the circumstances. They also noted that there was still an enormous amount of uncertainty in the exact timing of the changes recorded by the ice cores, so that it wasn‚Äôt clear there even was a lag as large as the contrarians claimed. But more to the point, the physics of the greenhouse effect are well-understood and entirely uncontroversial. A guy named Joseph Fourier had it pretty much figured out all the way back in the 1820s (Pierrehumbert, 2004). This is about as solid as science can get, the climate scientists insisted. Our present increase of greenhouse gases will result in increasing temperature, and no amount of arguing about ice cores can negate that. You can‚Äôt cheat physics. The contrarians, convinced of their out, were unpersuaded. The arguments in comments sections of blogs and news articles raged on. And then a funny thing happened- the lag disappeared. Jeremy Shakun and some of his colleagues had an idea. Noting that the temperature data ‚Äúleading‚Äù the CO2 in the ice core record were an estimation of local conditions near the core site in the Antarctic interior, they set out to reconstruct regional and eventually global temperature change as we thawed out of the Last Glacial Maximum (what most people call ‚Äúthe ice age‚Äù). Last year, they published a paper showing that global temperature change followed changes in CO2 rather than the reverse (Shakun et al., 2012). Milankovitch cycles initiated warming of the Northern Hemisphere, which melted a great deal of freshwater previously locked up in ice. This freshwater melting disrupted a global oceanic heat pump, resulting in a cooling of temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This hemispheric heat switcheroo is known as a ‚Äúbipolar seesaw‚Äù. As the Southern Ocean warmed during this seesaw, it released CO2 into the atmosphere. This increase in CO2 then warmed the rest of the globe. CO2 was driving warming globally, even though it wasn‚Äôt the initial trigger. Shakun et al. further found that the Southern Hemisphere warming and CO2 increase were closely coordinated, happening within a few hundred years at most, and possibly simultaneously. A few months later, a group of researchers led by Joel Pedro published a paper on the lag issue looking at another perspective. Noting the large uncertainty in timing associated with the longer ice core records from the interior of Antarctica, they turned to ice core records from the Antarctic coast (Pedro et al., 2012). These records don‚Äôt reach as far back into the past as the records from the interior, but were able to be dated more precisely. Like Shakun‚Äôs team, Pedro and colleagues found that the changes in Antarctic temperature did not lead changes in CO2 by 800 or 1,000 years, but rather the two changed pretty much together. This March, a third group of researchers led by Fr√©d√©ric Parrenin independently confirmed this finding. Parrenin et al. attacked the lag issue from still another angle. Instead of reducing uncertainty in the timing of events by looking in other regions, they used the behavior of atmospheric nitrogen isotopes in settling within snowpack prior to freezing to better constrain the age of the existing data (Parrenin et al., 2013). In doing so they found, like Pedro and colleagues, there was essentially no lag between Antarctic temperature increases and CO2 increases. These multiple lines of independent evidence were telling the same story- more or less what climate scientists had been trying to explain all along. Local temperature and CO2 increased together, a consequence of the orbitally-triggered warming up north and a resulting bipolar seesaw, while CO2 then drove warming globally. The greenhouse effect endures, vindicated and implacable. The coupling of CO2 and temperature in the ice core record is a reminder that some technicality buried in the pages of a journal isn‚Äôt going to divorce our actions from their consequences. There is no loophole when it comes to physics. As we continue to drive CO2 levels ever higher, that‚Äôs something all of us- not just contrarians- should keep in mind.

It is not clear why he eventually went over to the dark side but I suspect that when his hair began to grey, he found that his good looks could no longer pull in the chicks so he felt that he needed a boost to his social acceptability. What he proposes below is certainly more rational than the thicket of regulations and policies that presently surround climate policies. So he is a good critic of such policies. I won\\'t reproduce the whole of his post below as he simply takes global warming as read. He gives no evidence for it at all. He is just playing establishment games On April 11, I was invited by the Electricity Consumers Research Council (ELCON) to debate carbon taxation with the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs Oren Cass at their Spring workshop in Washington, D.C. Although the debate was not recorded, it is worth discussing. Cass is one of the most prominent and serious ‚Äúanti-carbon-taxers‚Äù on the right. His opinions, moreover, track those of Bill Gates, one of the most influential thought leaders in this field. Our debate was a confrontation along increasingly familiar lines: Does the world need a clean energy moonshot to address climate change, or do we have the cost effective technology to do so right now? My opening remarks follow, after which I will spend a bit of time reflecting on Cass‚Äôs rebuttal. Opening Remarks: The Dangers We Face, the Question of Uncertainty, and the Case for a Carbon Tax Too many conversations about carbon taxation are bereft of any serious discussion about the underlying problem that we‚Äôre trying to address. So let‚Äôs begin with a quick review of our present situation, which is far more serious than Cass‚Äôs recent essay in Foreign Affairs (‚ÄúThe Problem with Climate Catastrophizing: The Case for Calm‚Äú) would have us believe. According to a new study from MIT, the planet is presently on track to experience a warming of 3-5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100. The range reflects our uncertainty about how quickly the planet will respond to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (a concept known in the profession as ‚Äútransient climate sensitivity‚Äù). MIT‚Äôs central estimate, however, is that a 4 degrees Celsius warming is the most likely outcome in 2100. Happily, Cass‚Äîunlike most opponents of climate action‚Äîaccepts the findings of mainstream science and, in his Foreign Affairs essay, accepts the 4C warming projection for 2100. Turning up the global thermostat by 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) is a very big deal. To put that warming into perspective: Global temperatures during the last ice age were only 4C cooler than pre-industrial norms. Increasing the global thermostat by 6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels has in the past delivered unto earth its most epic hothouses (think ‚ÄúAge of the Dinosaurs‚Äù). The last time the atmosphere had today‚Äôs high concentrations of greenhouse gases was during the late Pliocene Epoch, some 3 million years ago. Temperatures then were only 2¬∞C to 3.6¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Under those conditions, there was no Arctic ice cap and sea levels were 30-65 feet higher. 4 degrees Celsius is not the endpoint of our warming under business-as-usual. It is simply a way-point. If we manage to stabilize atmospheric CO2 from then on, inertial warming of the climate will continue beyond 2100. It isn‚Äôt until anthropogenic emissions hit zero that we will begin to plausibly reverse course on global temperature. The MIT report indicates that global emissions in 2100 will still be larger than they are today. We have little idea how, precisely, the planet will respond to such an unprecedentedly rapid increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases. There are literally no data points either in human or pre-human experience to inform our analysis. Nassim Taleb‚Äôs parade of black swans is marching down the street. A long list of socio-economic shocks is plausibly on the horizon. Given the uncertainty regarding transient climate sensitivity, where the various tipping points lie for warming-related climate shocks, what the economy will look like decades hence, and how that economy will respond, we cannot say with confidence what warming will cost us by the year 2100. Here are the best (if imperfect) guesses: William Nordhaus‚Äôs updated DICE model finds that 4C warming will reduce global GDP by 3.6%. The majority of economists who publish in the peer-reviewed literature on this matter, however, suspect that his forecast is too conservative. They believe that 3C warming will reduce global GDP by 5-10%. If it turns out that warming affects output growth rates rather than output levels, the cost of warming will increase by many orders of magnitude (for more on this, see economists Robert Pindyck and Geoffrey Heal and Jisung Park). A recent deluge of econometric analyses of temperatures and growth rates shows this could very well be the case. Incidentally, 78% of the economists who publish in the peer-reviewed literature in this field believe that climate damages will affect growth rates. When those same economists were asked about the chances of low-probability, high-impact outcomes from climate change reducing global GDP by 25% or more (economic losses, in other words, on the order of the Great Depression), they put the odds of that happening at 10-20% given a 3C warming. Cass has asked me to be concrete about the carbon tax I‚Äôm advocating. My preference is for an economy-wide $45 per ton carbon tax, rising 2% above inflation every year. The tax would be applied or rebated at the border (as necessary) so that U.S. manufacturers are not rendered uncompetitive with imports from non-acting states or exports to the same. Federal regulatory authority to address greenhouse gas emissions would be eliminated in sub-sectors of the economy where the tax is applied. I am agnostic about how the federal government uses carbon tax revenues (about $2 trillion over ten years) for the purpose of this discussion. The immediate need is to reduce emissions to hedge against climate risks. How revenues from that undertaking are spent is an entirely separate (fiscal) matter. Among possibly attractive uses are offsets for corporate income tax rate cuts, providing lump-sum rebates to households to compensate them for rising energy prices, paying down the national debt, offsetting expenditures for national infrastructure, investing in low-carbon energy R&D, and investments in climate adaptation (better that polluters rather than victims of pollution pay that bill). The tax I propose would reduce U.S. emissions by around 40% relative to business-as-usual by the mid-to-late 2020s. That would put us on a path to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-80% by 2050 (relative to 2005)‚Äîthe goal that would allow us to play our part in keeping global warming from going above 2C. SOURCE \\nThe Liberal Crusade to Redefine Science It seems every weekend brings a march for one cause or another in D.C. Last weekend, folks marched for science. Or did they? In his preface to ‚ÄúMere Christianity,‚Äù C. S. Lewis explains what happens when words lose their original meaning. Take the word ‚Äúgentleman.‚Äù Once upon a time, Lewis writes, a gentleman was ‚Äúone who had a coat of arms and some landed property. When you called someone ‚Äòa gentleman,‚Äô you were not paying him a compliment, but merely stating a fact.‚Äù Gradually, however, ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù evolved into just that‚Äîa compliment. A true gentleman was no longer someone who met the objective qualifications, but a person whom the speaker liked. Thus, concludes Lewis, ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù became a useless word. I think another important word is undergoing this same redefinition. That word, alas, is science. There was a time when ‚Äúscience‚Äù meant the systematic pursuit of knowledge through experimentation and observation. But it‚Äôs rapidly becoming a synonym for progressive politics and materialist philosophy. To be labeled a ‚Äúscience-denier‚Äù in 2017 often just means you‚Äôve upset someone who insists on teaching strict, Darwinian orthodoxy in schools, or who advocates particular climate legislation, or who supports ethically fraught research on embryos. In contrast, being ‚Äúpro-science‚Äù has become a shibboleth for supporting progressive ideology. Think of a recent ad by National Geographic with the caption, ‚ÄúStand behind the facts. Stand with science. Stand for the planet.‚Äù But just weeks prior, National Geographic had run a cover depicting a nine-year-old boy dressed as a girl. Because, as we know, they stand with science. But if there were ever going to be a ceremony inaugurating this new and useless definition of science, it‚Äôs got to be last weekend‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarch for Science‚Äù in the nation‚Äôs capital, co-chaired by Bill Nye, ‚Äúthe science guy.‚Äù Nye, a children‚Äôs TV host from the nineties with no formal training as a scientist, has recaptured the spotlight with his videos on climate change, abortion, women‚Äôs rights, and other topics. To say his arguments in some of these videos are embarrassing is being kind. For instance, in one odd and rambling speech promoting abortion, Nye claimed that because many lives end through natural causes before they leave the womb that it‚Äôs okay for us to kill the unborn ourselves. That‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs okay to kill adults, because millions die of natural causes. That does not stop Nye‚Äôs supporters from honoring him as a champion of science. But not all of the marchers are fans. After issuing several revisions to his massive ‚ÄúStatement on Diversity and Inclusion,‚Äù the organizers of the March for Science are fending off critics who complain that Nye is a white male whose fame is the result of privilege. One wonders who, exactly, was in charge of this debacle. An official tweet, which has since been deleted, declared that ‚ÄúColonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism, queer-, trans-, intersex-phobia, & econ[omic] justice are scientific issues.‚Äù Heather Wilhelm at National Review got it right when she wrote that the whole event was collapsing into a civil war of competing left-wing agendas. I hope someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîwho still believes science has a definition independent of politics will speak up. Because whether it‚Äôs the denial that life begins at conception, the denial of sex and gender as biological facts, the denial of decades of research proving that children do best with their father and mother, or the denial of dissenting voices on Darwinism, the left has proven quite capable of ignoring science. Language is powerful. Words matter. And ‚Äúscience‚Äù‚Äîreal science‚Äîis too important a word for us to let go the way of ‚Äúgentleman.‚Äù SOURCE \\nThe March for Science Fiction One of the asinine yet oft-repeated phrases in the modern progressive lexicon is ‚Äúsettled science,‚Äù an oxymoron that is the antithesis of the scientific method. The literal definition of the scientific method is ‚Äúa method of procedure ‚Ä¶ consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.‚Äù Modification means alteration or change. Meaning that in science, many, many things are never ‚Äúsettled.‚Äù Among the most well-known theories that have been debunked over time are that the world is flat, that the solar system is geocentric (it is heliocentric), that the physical world is made up of four elements (rather than more than a hundred currently known elements, including four new elements discovered just last year), and that atoms are the smallest units of matter. Each and every one of these was once universally accepted as infallible truth. This makes the recent ‚ÄúMarch for Science‚Äù in Washington, DC, not only ludicrous, but an indictment of those marching while claiming to believe in science. It was not about science, but about publicly rebuking President Donald Trump behind the thin patina of ideology masquerading as science. The leftist mainstream media played its part well, praising the event while ignoring dissent from actual scientists. With scathing wit, Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital in Boston and a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School, exposed the hypocrisy and lunacy of the march ‚Äî in the lefty rag Slate, no less. He observed, ‚ÄúBeing ‚Äòpro-science‚Äô has become a bizarre cultural phenomenon in which liberals (and other members of the cultural elite) engage in public displays of self-reckoned intelligence as a kind of performance art, while demonstrating zero evidence to justify it.‚Äù Instead of elevating the quality of, and respect for, actual science, says Faust, this march ‚Äúrevealed the glaring dissonance of opposing that trough of ignorance by instead accepting a cringe-worthy hive-mind mentality that celebrates Science as a vague but wonderful entity. ‚Ä¶ There was an uncomfortable dronelike fealty to the concept ‚Äî an oxymoronic faith that information presented and packaged to us as Science need not be further scrutinized before being smugly celebrated en masse. That is not intellectually rigorous thought ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs another kind of religion.‚Äù Indeed, progressive Democrats claim to be the ‚ÄúParty of Science‚Äù yet, mind-bogglingly argue that sex/gender is determined by how one ‚Äúfeels‚Äù rather than by DNA and plumbing. They accept man-made global warming (now known as ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù to free themselves of the pesky fact that the Earth stopped warming for nearly two decades) as inarguable fact. These are the same people who chain themselves to trees to protest the ‚Äúdestruction‚Äù of Mother Earth, but refuse to acknowledge that a baby in utero is a living human being. In short, they are modern-day pagans, worshipping ‚ÄúGaia‚Äù while denying observable truths that conflict with their secular religion, and seeking punishment for the heretics who dare challenge their belief system with something so coarse, so crude and as unenlightened as mere facts. The ultimate goal of the progressive religionists is to force compliance with their worldview, either through the coercive power of rigid, politically correct orthodoxy, or through punishment such as jail time for ‚Äúclimate change dissenters/deniers,‚Äù a position embraced by leftist celebrity and fake TV scientist Bill Nye ‚ÄúThe Science Guy.‚Äù CNN, in an interview with Nye and an actual scientist, physicist William Happer of Princeton, inadvertently displayed the truth behind the march with a caption that read ‚ÄúMarch for Science: Scientists Rally for EPA, Govt Funding and More.‚Äù Climate change hysteria is a big business. If you are a scientist, you have access to billions of dollars in federal grants so long as you produce ‚Äúresearch‚Äù that proves the claims of the alarmists. Politicians pushing climate hysteria can usurp tremendous power over the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the name of saving the world from cataclysmic disaster. The reality is that ‚Äúscience,‚Äù across a broad spectrum of disciplines, is not nearly as ‚Äúsettled‚Äù as its advocates would have us believe. In fact, the most-repeated claims have a habit of turning out to be spectacularly wrong. For example, as we‚Äôve noted previously, leftist climate alarmists have been trying to scare us into giving up the abundant energy and higher standard of living that comes with industrialization. They warned that ‚Äúcivilization will end within 15 or 30 years‚Äù (Harvard biologist George Wald, 1970), and that (due to scarce food supplies), ‚ÄúThe death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years‚Äù (Paul Ehrlich, 1970), and that by 1980 ‚Äúurban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution.‚Äù They are often insanely wrong in their predictions, and are so wedded to their ideology that they can‚Äôt even identify fake science even when it is specifically written to be obviously wrong. Time after time, robotically generated ‚Äúgibberish papers‚Äù were accepted in supposedly peer-reviewed journals. As amusing as this can be, it‚Äôs actually dangerous. The beauty of science is that it is ruthless. It cares not for sex, race, education or socio-economic status. It cares only about replicable fact. But when science ‚Äî actual science ‚Äî is hijacked by partisans and ideologues, and propaganda is passed off as science, it undermines our faith in science, and therefore the truth. And that is never a good thing. SOURCE \\nUK foreign office cut climate staff in half under Tory government The UK foreign office has almost halved the staff it devotes to climate change over the term of the past two Conservative-led governments. Staffing records, released by the foreign office under freedom of information laws, show the previous Labour government more than trebled the amount of time devoted by foreign office staff to climate and energy issues between 2007 and 2009. As the world built momentum towards ultimately calamitous 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, foreign secretary David Miliband headed an army of climate staff, the equivalent of 277 full time jobs. No such recruitment effort took place under the Tory government of David Cameron ‚Äì who came to power promising an environmentally friendly agenda under the slogan ‚ÄúVote Blue, Go Green‚Äù ‚Äì in the build up for the decisive talks that took place in Paris six years later. On the contrary, over the six years of Cameron‚Äôs government, the amount of time foreign office staff spent on climate and energy fell by 46%. When the Paris agreement was struck, the foreign office had between 149 and 158 full time equivalent jobs in climate-related roles worldwide. The UK is a self-styled key advocate for greater ambition at climate negotiations. In the months leading up to the Paris conference, the foreign secretary‚Äôs special representative for climate change David King helped to develop Mission Innovation, a collaboration between 22 countries and the EU to double public funding for clean energy research and development investment over five years. Foreign office embassy staff and UK-based officials also provide support for the energy department, which leads UK negotiations at UN climate conferences. A spokesperson from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said: ‚ÄúClimate change and energy work is a network-wide priority. The FCO works closely in partnership with departments across Whitehall on the international climate change agenda.‚Äù As campaigning begins for the UK‚Äôs June election, the Labour Party‚Äôs spokesperson on climate change Barry Gardiner said the ‚Äústaggering cut in the number of FCO staff working on climate change shows that the Government is not serious about implementing the Paris Agreement‚Äù. He referred to a report in the Times this month that prime minister Theresa May plans to ‚Äúscale down‚Äù concern about climate change in order to win new trade partners post-Brexit. ‚ÄúHow can the public have any respect for politicians who are all too happy to sit there for the photo at the signing ceremony but then don‚Äôt deliver what is in the agreement? Theresa May has done the same on UK emissions and renewables. The implementation plan that was due last July has now been delayed indefinitely,‚Äù said Gardiner. ‚ÄúUnder Labour the UK led the world in climate policy. We need a Labour government that will transform our country at home into a low carbon high value economy; and abroad will give the resources and the leadership required to deliver the Paris Agreement.‚Äù SOURCE For more postings from me, see DISSECTING LEFTISM , TONGUE-TIED , EDUCATION WATCH INTERNATIONAL , POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WATCH , FOOD & HEALTH SKEPTIC and AUSTRALIAN POLITICS .

Then, when challenged on ethical grounds, they say it is very safe The issue of small particle air pollution human effects was discussed in a House of Representatives hearing in September 2011 by the U.S. EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson. In a colloquy with Representative Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ms. Jackson stated, \"Particulate matter causes premature death. It\\'s directly causal to dying sooner than you should.\" Markey asked, \"How would you compare [the benefits of reducing airborne PM2.5] to the fight against cancer?\" Ms. Jackson replied, \"Yeah, I was briefed not long ago. If we could reduce particulate matter to healthy levels, it would have the same impact as finding a cure for cancer in our country.\" Markey: \"Can you say that sentence one more time?\" Jackson: \"Yes sir. If ‚Äì um ‚Äì we could reduce particulate matter to levels that are healthy, we could have identical impacts to finding a cure for cancer.\" (Author note: Cancer kills a half-million Americans a year ‚Äì 25 percent of all deaths in the U.S. annually). The claim stated above by Ms. Jackson is the basis for the EPA\\'s war on coal, fossil fuels, and internal combustion engines. All other criteria air pollutants are minimal concerns for the EPA. Surely small particles are a very toxic and lethal thing, as bad as cancer. Right? EPA is discovered doing human experiments The same month as Ms. Jackson\\'s testimony, Milloy discovered a report in Environmental Health Perspectives, a journal published online and in hard copy by the National Institutes of Health, that reported an experiment on a 57-year-old lady subjected to small particle air pollution much higher than the EPA says is safe, in a chamber at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine EPA laboratory for human research. A stunned Milloy showed the journal report to Dunn. So little had come of the decade of human experiments before that Milloy and Dunn had not known of the EPA human exposure experiments project that was at least illegal and unethical, possibly a crime against humanity. Humans are not guinea pigs. The Nuremberg Code; the Helsinki Accords; the Belmont Report; and U.S. common law, statutes, and regulations, to include state laws and the Federal Code \"Common Rule\" and EPA rule 1000.17, all prohibit human experimentation that might cause harm to the subjects. Human risk can be considered only for the researchers themselves in circumstances where the research is essential and vital. The civil or criminal offense of human experimentation that risks harm to the subjects would be either exposure to harm or the fear of harm by infliction of mental distress if subjects found out that the public position of the EPA is that small particles are toxic and lethal and cause cancer. Which lie to believe? That is the twist ‚Äì you can\\'t make these things up. In 2011 and 2012, Milloy and Dunn wrote letters to the EPA, the NIH journal editor who published the article, the EPA inspector general, and the federal Office for Scientific Integrity. They wrote to all the physicians in Congress, all the deans of the ten domestic medical schools doing human experiments, and state medical boards in North Carolina and Michigan, all attempting to stop the human experiments. The authors have written about the EPA project of research that exposed human beings of all ages, even children, to that same small particle air pollution to see if they could cause some harm. EPA sponsorship of these studies at ten domestic and six foreign medical schools was admitted under oath by an EPA official, Wayne Cascio, M.D., and it is unethical and illegal. Senior EPA research scientist Robert Devlin, Ph.D. admitted in a sworn affidavit that the EPA epidemiology was unreliable, the reason for human experiments. EPA hires the National Academy of Science The EPA, in response to a congressional inquiry and negative inspector general report, engaged and paid the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) contract subdivision, the National Research Council (NRC), to provide a whitewash investigation. The NAS National Research Council Investigative Committee was convened in secret without notice and without contacting Milloy and Dunn, the complaining parties, or the congressional committee that had demanded an inspector general report that had gone badly for the EPA. The closeted investigation continued with closed meetings attended only by NRC staff, committee members, and the EPA. The docket by a year, June of 2016, had 50 documents, all submitted by the EPA or its allies. In May of 2016, a congressional aide ran across information about the existence of the committee and informed Milloy. Milloy demanded a hearing and allowance for submissions in June of 2016, which was granted by NRC officials. Milloy found that 13 out of 19 members of the committee were significant grantees of EPA, amounting to tens of millions of dollars received, with the most extreme example being Charles Driscoll, discussed here. On August 11, 2016, an internet audio conference of the National Research Council Panel on EPA-sponsored human exposure experiments titled \"Assessing Toxicological Risks to Human Subjects Used in Controlled Exposure Studies of Environmental Pollutants\" was held, with two hours of testimony heard and submissions critical of the EPA human exposure experimentation. After that, nothing was heard from the committee. The committee published its news release and a 150-plus-page report on March 28, 2017, ignoring the testimony and submissions of witnesses Milloy, Dunn, Young, Enstrom, and Donnay. The report exonerated the EPA human experiments on the theory that small particles are not toxic or lethal or carcinogenic acutely ‚Äì that is, they do not have any acute toxic effects, but rather just long-term deleterious effects. They said that, knowing that the EPA asserts short-term acute death effects and justifies its regulations on the basis of Ms. Jackson\\'s claim ‚Äì that small particles kill people and kill them acutely. The problem for the NRC committee is that they are trying to create cover for the EPA by misstating the EPA position on toxicity and lethality of small particles. That is clear from this quote from the National Academy of Sciences Report press release: To assess the level of safety provided by study protocols and the likelihood of participants experiencing any serious health effects with long-term consequences, the committee reviewed eight recent CHIE studies. The committee concluded that the societal benefits of CHIE studies are greater than the risks posed to the participants in the eight studies considered, which are unlikely to be large enough to be of concern. EPA applies a broad set of health-evaluation criteria when selecting participants to determine that there is no reason to believe that their participation in the study will lead to an adverse health response. The health status of subjects is monitored shortly before, during, and immediately after the exposure studies and usually again about 24 hours later. The NAS report is self-destructive, obfuscatory, contradictory gobbledygook. The NAS report is so filled with errors, omissions, misstatements, misdirection, and general dishonesty that it would take days if not weeks to fully critique. The NAS compromised its integrity to cover for the EPA, confirming Eisenhower\\'s warning about the government-research complex that can produce science fraud and misconduct for a political agenda. Scaremongering is important for justifying government growth and overreach. After all, the aim of practical politics is to create scares so the populace will be anxious and clamor to be led to safety by government experts (paraphrasing H.L. Mencken). If the EPA can continue to do these experiments, then it must not be true that any exposure to PM2.5 can kill within hours or days, or even weeks. It must have only a \"chronic\" long-term effect that the NRC committee fails to define. That destroys the basis for the EPA air pollution regulatory regime that has burdened society for three decades and more and is based on scientific misconduct. Who will reimburse society for the costs and burdens of this scam? How about all those coal miners without jobs and the companies that had to spend millions to comply with regulations chasing a phantom small particle air pollution menace that was claimed to kill hundreds of thousands annually in the U.S.? The movie Creature from the Black Lagoon, featuring the gill man, was scary, but corrupt researchers and politicians at the EPA-NAS-D.C. swamp are just despicable. A comprehensive and informative narrative of the EPA wars and the EPA misconduct and what to do about it is found in Milloy\\'s sixth and most recent book, Scare Pollution (Bench Press 2016). Dunn\\'s long battle with the EPA on scientific integrity is told here. SOURCE \\nFracking isn\\'t contaminating groundwater, study finds A major anti-fracking argument by environmentalists may not have the facts to back it up, a new study conducted by Duke University found. Fracking has not contaminated groundwater in northwestern West Virginia, according to the peer-reviewed study published this month in a European journal. ‚ÄúBased on consistent evidence from comprehensive testing, we found no indication of groundwater contamination over the three-year course of our study,‚Äù explained Avner Vengosh, the professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke‚Äôs Nicholas School of the Environment. The growing industry could help create as many as 3.5 million jobs by 2035, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While the study concluded that fracking didn‚Äôt contaminate groundwater, the researchers did say accidental spills of fracking wastewater could be dangerous to surface water in the area. ‚ÄùHowever, we did find that spill water associated with fracked wells and their wastewater has an impact on the quality of streams in areas of intense shale gas development,‚Äù Vengosh added. ‚ÄúThe bottom-line assessment,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúis that groundwater is so far not being impacted, but surface water is more readily contaminated because of the frequency of spills.‚Äù To complete the research, water samples from 112 drinking wells in northwestern West Virginia were evaluated during a three year period. Twenty of the water wells were sampled prior to drilling or fracking started in the area in order to obtain a baseline for later comparisons. Tests demonstrated the presence of saline groundwater and methane in both the pre-drilling and post-drilling well water samples. But the samples had a chemistry slightly but distinctly different from the methane and salts found in fracking fluids and shale gas. The findings indicated that the elements occurred naturally in the region‚Äôs permeable rock and weren‚Äôt related to the result of recent shale gas operations at the site. The study appears in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. SOURCE \\nUK: We‚Äôre All Victims Of The Great Green Swindle A generation who thought they were doing the right thing by buying diesel and clean energy have been taken for a ride. When I was three my parents moved next to one of the busiest roundabouts in Europe. Hogarth roundabout in west London leads to the M3 and M4 and the smell of car fumes was only overpowered by the aroma of hops from the brewery on the corner. It was the perfect place to grow up. We had a huge green in front where we could stand on the railings and count the number of cars whizzing past. No one in the 1970s worried about the lead pollution, only about being run over. Nor did we care about where our electricity came from unless the lights went out. Green issues were not high on our agenda nor was our health. Our neighbours happily smoked away and we ate tinned spaghetti hoops and Angel Delight without a care for the sugar content. Now my family is as green and healthy as possible. We recycle our apple cores, the children play sport every day under the Westway flyover, we bought a second-hand diesel car and then a hybrid and take the train to Devon for holidays. But the children are probably less healthy than I was 40 years ago. When the youngest started to wheeze I took him to the doctor who said he had doubled the number of inhalers he hands out in the past three years, so many children are becoming asthmatic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the diesel, all that nitrogen dioxide and those toxic pollutants,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll inhale the particles in the car even with the windows shut, when he‚Äôs playing football by a busy road and even from the trains at the station.‚Äù Our obsession with cutting carbon emissions has had terrible consequences. Air pollution contributes to an estimated 40,000 premature deaths a year in Britain, mainly among the young, the frail and the elderly, according to the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health. It can also hinder brain development, raise the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer, and contribute to the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs. Our attempts to be altruistic have harmed rather than helped the most vulnerable. Almost as bad, those 11 million people who now own a diesel car are about to be penalised for following government advice a decade ago that the vehicles would help the country cut CO2 emissions. [...] Gordon Brown‚Äôs budget of 1998 may have said in the small print that the government ‚Äúrecognises the adverse effect that the use of diesel has on local air quality‚Äù but first as chancellor and then as prime minister he shifted incentives towards diesel, until more than 35 per cent of cars were running on it, while manufacturers fiddled their engine management systems to cheat the testers. Japan, meanwhile, steered consumers away from polluting diesel, America stuck to petrol and India began switching buses to compressed natural gas (CNG). The same mistake is now being made subsidising power stations to burn American wood pellets that are doing more harm to the climate than the coal they replaced, according to a recent Chatham House report. Drax in Yorkshire, once the largest, cleanest, most efficient coal-fired power station in Europe, has been converted to burn wood pellets with an annual ¬£500 million public subsidy but it now pumps out more CO2. Wind farms are little better because we‚Äôve had to build diesel power plants across the country to help on days when the wind doesn‚Äôt blow at the right speed. One Scottish stately home owner boasted to me that he keeps his heating on in the summer as well as the winter because he is paid more in subsidies to use ‚Äúgreen‚Äù wood chips for fuel than he pays out in heating costs. All this while the rest of us worry about our escalating energy bills. Anaerobic digesters, which were sold to the public as a means to convert food waste into power, are now turning huge quantities of crops into small quantities of methane for the national gas grid thanks to yet more subsidies costing ¬£200 million a year. But it is car manufacturers who are still making the most money out of this great green swindle ‚Äî consumers certainly aren‚Äôt. Diesel owners now face having to buy another car at vast expense. Scrappage payments of between ¬£1,000 and ¬£2,000 for the oldest diesel cars would help those hardest hit. However, if we subsidise new electric cars we will have to accept that much of the electricity used to charge their batteries comes from power stations using fossil fuels ‚Äî or wood chips. This week Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, shelved a new plan for air quality. But Downing Street policy advisers hint that Theresa May is on the side of the consumer, and sceptical of the latest money-spinning environmental fad. Last year, the prime minister‚Äôs joint chief of staff Nick Timothy described the Climate Change Act, which has been at the root of many of these misguided policies, as ‚Äúa monstrous act of national self-harm‚Äù. He was right. As soon as the election is over Britain needs a coordinated energy strategy and a new Clean Air Act, to protect the environment and restore faith in government policy. SOURCE \\nSettled science? 107 cancer papers retracted due to peer review fraud The Warmist reliance on peer-review as a warrant of truth is badly flawed The journal Tumor Biology is retracting 107 research papers after discovering that the authors faked the peer review process. This isn‚Äôt the journal‚Äôs first rodeo. Late last year, 58 papers were retracted from seven different journals‚Äî 25 came from Tumor Biology for the same reason. It‚Äôs possible to fake peer review because authors are often asked to suggest potential reviewers for their own papers. This is done because research subjects are often blindingly niche; a researcher working in a sub-sub-field may be more aware than the journal editor of who is best-placed to assess the work. But some journals go further and request, or allow, authors to submit the contact details of these potential reviewers. If the editor isn‚Äôt aware of the potential for a scam, they then merrily send the requests for review out to fake e-mail addresses, often using the names of actual researchers. And at the other end of the fake e-mail address is someone who‚Äôs in on the game and happy to send in a friendly review. Fake peer reviewers often ‚Äúknow what a review looks like and know enough to make it look plausible,‚Äù said Elizabeth Wager, editor of the journal Research Integrity & Peer Review. But they aren‚Äôt always good at faking less obvious quirks of academia: ‚ÄúWhen a lot of the fake peer reviews first came up, one of the reasons the editors spotted them was that the reviewers responded on time,‚Äù Wager told Ars. Reviewers almost always have to be chased, so ‚Äúthis was the red flag. And in a few cases, both the reviews would pop up within a few minutes of each other.‚Äù It‚Äôs not always the authors providing the reviews. \"There is some evidence that so-called third-party language-editing services play a role in manipulating the reviewing process,‚Äù said a spokesperson for Springer, the company that published Tumor Biology until this year. Scientists who work in a language other than English may use editing services to polish their papers before submitting to a journal, and some of these services can be unethical and predatory, says Wager. It might be naive, she says, but ‚Äúif the authors didn\\'t realize that this is what the editing company was doing, then I feel the authors should have a fair chance. There\\'s probably nothing wrong with the research; it just hasn\\'t been peer reviewed.‚Äù But of course, it‚Äôs difficult to assess whether the authors knew about it. ‚ÄúIt is unclear whether the authors of the manuscripts were aware that the agencies were proposing fabricated reviewer names/e-mail addresses,‚Äù the Springer spokesperson told Ars. This most recent avalanche of fake-reviewed papers was discovered because of extra screening at the journal. According to an official statement from Springer, ‚Äúthe decision was made to screen new papers before they are released to production.‚Äù The extra screening turned up the names of fake reviewers that hadn‚Äôt previously been detected, and ‚Äúin order to clean up our scientific records, we will now start retracting these affected articles...Springer will continue to proactively investigate these issues.‚Äù It‚Äôs best for editors not to rely on the contact details submitted by authors, but rather search for proper academic e-mail addresses themselves, said Wager. Some journals include this in their editorial guidelines, and other institutions recommend it as best practice. But there are other ways to game the system. Tumor Biology changed hands in January, and the new publishers, SAGE, were aware of the problems when they took over. ‚Äú[Springer] were open about the past instances of peer review fraud, and as part of the relaunch they wanted to address the underlying reasons,‚Äù a SAGE spokesperson told Retraction Watch. ‚ÄúThe Tumor Biology editorial team have already introduced new robust peer review practices expected from all SAGE journals.‚Äù However, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean no more retractions for the journal, since investigations like this recent one may turn up more dirt from the past. jooced wrote: The U.S. EPA and Dept of Science should take note of this.

See here or here 26 April, 2017 Clean Energy‚Äôs Dirty Federal Cronyism Earth Day started as a protest but has long been a mainstream institution. It‚Äôs therefore fitting that the cause it represents often reflects an even older American institution: politicization and cronyism in government spending. In recent testimony to Congress, Independent Institute Research Fellow Ryan M. Yonk explained how the Department of Energy‚Äôs loan guarantee program exemplifies those unhealthy by-products of government intervention as it creates additional unhealthy by-products. The loan guarantee program ‚Äúhas been used as a political tool, exposed taxpayers to unnecessary risk, diverted funding from alternative clean energy investments, and primarily benefitted large, politically connected corporations,‚Äù Ryan states in his written testimony. Moreover, the program is counterproductive. ‚ÄúThe fundamental problem,‚Äù he continues, ‚Äúis that the loan guarantee program makes it more difficult for new ideas to emerge since it further entrenches established ideas.‚Äù Case in point: Solyndra. It was a struggling young company rather than an established firm with large market share, but the solar-systems manufacturer was the darling of a president and energy secretary who were so eager for a political win that federal bureaucrats approved its loan guarantees without completing essential steps required by other applicants. The loan guarantees program also diverts scarce investment funds away from firms who avoid feeding at the public trough. Writes Yonk: ‚ÄúGovernment support, as a previous chief marketing officer at Tesla Motors complained, may make it easier for those who receive support, but it also makes it more difficult for new ideas to gain private funding and grow.‚Äù SOURCE \\nNew Study Calls EPA‚Äôs Labeling Of CO2 A Pollutant ‚ÄòTotally False‚Äô A new study published by seasoned researchers takes aim at the heart of the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs (EPA) authority to issue regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions. The study claims to have ‚Äúproven that it is all but certain that EPA‚Äôs basic claim that CO2 is a pollutant is totally false,‚Äù according to a press statement put out by Drs. Jim Wallace, John Christy and Joe D‚ÄôAleo. Wallace, Christy and D‚ÄôAleo ‚Äî a statistician, a climatologist and meteorologist, respectively ‚Äî released a study claiming to invalidate EPA‚Äôs 2009 endangerment finding, which allowed the agency to regulate CO2 as a pollutant. ‚ÄúThis research failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 14 temperature data sets that were analyzed,‚Äù the authors say in the release for the second edition of their peer-reviewed work. ‚ÄúMoreover, these research results clearly demonstrate that once the solar, volcanic and oceanic activity, that is, natural factor, impacts on temperature data are accounted for, there is no ‚Äòrecord setting‚Äô warming to be concerned about,‚Äù the researchers say. ‚ÄúIn fact, there is no natural factor adjusted warming at all.‚Äù The study is intended to bolster a petition Wallace and D‚ÄôAleo filed with EPA as part of the Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC), asking the agency to reconsider its endangerment finding. The libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) also filed a petition with EPA to reconsider the endangerment finding. The Trump administration has not indicated whether or not they will reconsider the Obama-era finding. Any challenge would be met with legal action from environmental activists. CHECC‚Äôs petition relies on findings from a 2016 study by Wallace and company that found the three lines of evidence EPA relied on for its 2009 endangerment finding weren‚Äôt scientifically sound. Wallace‚Äôs new study makes a similar finding, arguing the ‚Äútropical hot spot‚Äù EPA claims will occur as humans pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere ‚Äúsimply does not exist in the real world.‚Äù EPA issued its endangerment finding for six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in 2009. The agency found that greenhouse gases from vehicles ‚Äúendanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.‚Äù The finding gave the Obama administration the legal cover it needed to move forward with regulations to clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, industrial facilities and agriculture. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March to roll back many Obama global warming policies and directives, but some say the administration needs to eliminate the endangerment finding to keep future presidents from regulating CO2. ‚ÄúClaims like that rest entirely on the endangerment finding,‚Äù said Sam Kazman, CEI‚Äôs general counsel. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Congress during his January confirmation hearing he saw no reason at the time to review the endangerment finding. Sources have also told news outlets Pruitt got Trump to strip language from an executive order that would have ordered a review of the endangerment finding. On the other hand, sources familiar with Pruitt‚Äôs thinking on the matter say he wants to review the endangerment finding, but is biding his time. Wallace and his coauthors want to give Pruitt a reason to update the endangerment finding. Wallace and company say in their release that ‚Äúthere is no published, peer reviewed, statistically valid proof that past increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have caused the officially reported rising, even claimed record setting temperatures.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd, EPA‚Äôs climate models fail to meet this test,‚Äù the authors say. SOURCE \\nBill Nye blows gasket when a real scientist schools him on facts about ‚Äòclimate change‚Äô Bill Nye, known for his 1990‚Äôs science kid‚Äôs show who has since become an outspoken advocate on ‚Äúclimate change,‚Äù accused CNN of doing a ‚Äúdisservice‚Äù to its audience on Saturday by having a real scientist on their network to discuss climate change. The CNN ‚ÄúNew Day Saturday‚Äù panel, which included Nye and William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University,‚Äù became heated after Happer said the climate change that Nye talks about is a ‚Äúmyth.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this myth that‚Äôs developed around carbon dioxide that it‚Äôs a pollutant, but you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath. Each of us emits about two pounds of carbon dioxide a day, so are we polluting the planet?‚Äù Happer, who has advised President Donald Trump on climate issues, said. ‚ÄúCarbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas, it‚Äôs just like water vapor, it‚Äôs something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide, and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,‚Äù he explained. Nye hit back and said Happer didn‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúrate,‚Äù or speed at which carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere. Then he ripped CNN for not having only climate change alarmists on their network. ‚ÄúAnd I will say, much as I love the CNN, you‚Äôre doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change,‚Äù Nye said. When asked why he‚Äôs a skeptic, Happer ‚Äî a real scientist ‚Äî explained that climate change alarmism is built on a dishonest foundation. ‚ÄúLet me point out that science is not like passing a law,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a vote to say how many are for the law of gravity and how many are against ‚Äî it‚Äôs based on observations. And if you observe what‚Äôs happening to, for example, the temperature, the temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted. It‚Äôs much, much less ‚Äî factors of two or three less. So the whole basis for the alarmism is not true, it‚Äôs based on flawed computer modeling.‚Äù Nye, who is not a real scientist, immediately shot back at Happer. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs completely wrong,‚Äù Nye shot back. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs cherry picking a certain model. The heat ended up in the ocean. This is not controversial in mainstream science, everybody.‚Äù Nye added that he ‚Äúencourages‚Äù everyone to look at the facts. For years, climate change alarmists said the polar ice caps would melt completely by the mid-2010‚Äôs causing the sea levels to rise by meters, which would then put low-lying coastal areas across the world under water. None of these things ever happened. In fact, ocean waters have not warmed on an overall average basis, despite claims made by people like Nye and former Vice President Al Gore. Not only that, but a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the government agency that monitors the climate, whistleblower said the agency for years manipulated climate data for political reasons ‚Äî meaning to show that climate change is happening when it really isn‚Äôt. Still, Nye spouted his talking points and lectured Happer for being a ‚Äúclimate change denier.‚Äù He said: I encourage you to cut this out so we can move forward and make the United States a world leader in technology. We want advanced wind turbines‚Ä¶advanced concentrated energy plants. If we were to do that, we would have at least 3 million new jobs in the United States that could not be outsourced. We would not need to have our military on the other of the world defending what people call ‚Äúour oil.‚Äù We could move forward and we could export this technology. We could be world leaders in this instead of wringing our hands and cherry picking data and pretending that this problem that‚Äôs obvious to the scientific community but it is somehow not obvious to you. Later in the interview, Happer said the Trump administration should back out of the 2016 Paris Agreement, a global agreement made last year on greenhouse gas emissions. Happer compared the agreement to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain‚Äôs appeasements of Germany dictator Adolf Hitler in 1938, known as the Munich Agreement. That agreement allowed Hitler to take over territory in what was then Czechoslovakia known as the ‚ÄúSudetenland.‚Äù Hitler said he wanted the territory because it was occupied mainly by Germans and Austrians. We now know, however, that it was just one more step in Hitler‚Äôs plan to begin conquering Europe. The comparison Happer made stunned Nye and the CNN hosts, who demanded that Happer explain his comparison. ‚ÄúIt is an appropriate comparison because it was a treaty that was not going to do any good,‚Äù Happer explained. ‚ÄúThis treaty also will not do any good. Anyone who looks at the results of doing what the treaty says can see that the effect on the earth‚Äôs climate is ‚Äî even if you take the alarmist computer models trivial ‚Äî it will not make any difference and yet it will cause enormous harm to many people.‚Äù The contentious exchange came on ‚ÄúEarth Day 2017,‚Äù also the same day that people across the world were marching ‚Äúfor science.‚Äù SOURCE \\nClimate Marches Aren\\'t About Science ‚Äî They\\'re About Trump Organizers promised that hundreds of thousands would participate in an April 22 March for Science planned for hundreds of cities worldwide and an April 29 People\\'s Climate March in Washington, DC. These events have no more to do with science or climate change than do UN programs or the Paris climate treaty. Their own leaders make that perfectly clear. A climate website asserts that marchers intend to mark President Trump\\'s 100th day in office \"with a massive demonstration that shows our resistance is not going to wane.\" They intend to \"block Trump\\'s entire fossil fuel agenda,\" with Berkeley-style tantrums and riots, most likely. A science march website says this is \"explicitly a political movement, aimed at holding leaders in science and politics accountable\" for trying to \"skew, ignore, misuse or interfere with science.\" That pious language really means they intend to allow no deviation from climate cataclysm doctrines. It means everyone must accept claims that fossil fuel emissions, not powerful natural forces, now govern Earth\\'s climate; any future changes will be catastrophic; despite growing wealth and technological prowess, humanity will somehow be unable to adapt to future fluctuations; and mankind can and must control the climate by regulating emissions of plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide, regardless of costs. Equally revealing, former UN climate convention director Christiana Figueres has said the UN goal is to \"intentionally change the economic development model\" that has reigned since the Industrial Revolution. \"Climate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with environmental protection,\" former IPCC mitigation group co-chair Ottmar Edenhofer has stated. It is about negotiating \"the distribution of the world\\'s resources.\" Indeed, under the Paris agreement, UN officials will oversee energy and economic \"transformations\" in industrialized nations, let poor countries develop using fossil fuels, and oversee the collection and redistribution of $100 billion annually in climate adaptation, mitigation and compensation funds. Developed nations must de-carbonize, de-industrialize, and reduce their growth, job creation and living standards ‚Äì while sending trillions of dollars over the coming decades to ruling elites in developing countries that are not required to decrease oil, gas and coal use or greenhouse gas emissions. The Insurance Journal says the worldwide climate change and renewable energy industry is now a $1.5-trillion-per-year business empire. McKinsey & Co. says the world must spend $93 trillion by 2031 to build \"climate-resilient, socially inclusive, sustainable, low-carbon\" infrastructures. Millions of politicians, bureaucrats, scientists, activists and corporate executives clearly have a huge stake in advancing this agenda. However, billions of people have other, more vital, even life-or-death interests that must be protected. Free enterprise capitalism and fossil fuels have lifted billions out of poverty, disease, malnutrition and early death. They must continue doing so. Indeed, says the Energy Information Administration, carbon-based fuels will provide 75-80% of worldwide energy through 2040 ‚Äì when total energy consumed will be at least 25% greater than today. The marchers seem determined to block this progress, regardless of the consequences. In the United States, their \"green\" energy policies would send gasoline prices soaring and at least double electricity costs ‚Äì from Ohio rates to California rates. The cost of heat, lights, AC, goods and services would skyrocket for families, hospitals, schools, factories and businesses. Living standards would decline, jobs disappear, drug and alcohol abuse climb, and people die needlessly and prematurely. 330,000 German families had their electricity cut off in 2015, because they could not pay soaring bills. In Britain, 20,000 elderly people die from illness and hypothermia each winter, because they cannot afford proper heat. Across Africa and India, over a billion impoverished people still have no access to electricity for lights, cooking or refrigeration. Instead, they burn wood, charcoal and dung in open fires. Millions die every year from breathing indoor smoke, drinking contaminated water, eating bacteria-infested food and having primitive healthcare. The marchers and climate industry ignore this green energy poverty and death. They dismiss hundreds of scientists who present persuasive evidence that humans are not causing climate disasters, as CFACT detailed in its documentary film, \"Climate Hustle.\" Danish environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg calculates that implementing all provisions of the Paris accord would prevent a virtually undetectable 0.306 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming by 2100. Doing so would cost up to $946 billion annually, from 2030 to 2100 ‚Äì another $66 trillion in total! That money should be spent on electricity, clean water, modern housing and agriculture. Free enterprise capitalism will gradually devise reliable, affordable fossil fuel replacements. The marchers claim they represent \"social, economic and climate justice.\" It\\'s nothing more than a twisted joke. SOURCE \\nDrifting Back to Diesel Power By Viv Forbes & Helpers When I was a kid on a dairy farm in Queensland, we relied on green energy - horses and human muscles provided motive power; fire-wood and beeswax candles supplied heat and light; windmills pumped water and the sun provided solar energy for growing crops, vegies and pastures. The only ‚Äúnon-green‚Äù energy used was a bit of kerosene for the kitchen lamp, and petrol for a small Ford utility. We were almost ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù but there was little surplus for others. Our life changed dramatically when we put a thumping diesel in the dairy shed. This single-cylinder engine drove the milking machines and an electricity generator which charged 16 lead-acid 2 volt batteries sitting on the veranda. This 32 volt DC system powered a modern marvel ‚Äì bright light, at any time, in every room, at the touch of a switch. This system could also power Mum‚Äôs new electric clothes iron as long as someone started the engine for a bit more power. There were no electric self-starters for diesels in those days ‚Äì just a heavy crank handle. But all that effort, noise and fumes were superseded when every house and dairy got connected to clean silent ‚Äúcoal power by wire‚Äù, and coal was used to produce coke for the new slow-combustion stoves. Suddenly the trusty ‚ÄúSouthern Cross‚Äù diesel engines disappeared from Australian sheds and dairies, AGA cookers displaced the old smoky wood-burning stoves in the kitchen, and clean-burning coal gas heaters replaced dirty open fires in the cities. In just one life-time, human energy, wood, candles and kerosene were replaced by diesel, which was then replaced by coal via coal-gas, coke, and clean silent ever-ready electricity. Today, after Aussies have enjoyed decades of abundant reliable cheap electricity from black coal, brown coal and hydro, green energy gambling has taken Australia back to the era which kept a diesel in the shed. Tasmania is the greenest state in Australia. It once had a vibrant economy that created mines, saw-mills, farms, orchards, oil and metal refineries, dams, hydro-power and railways. It is now a green no-go land. Greens have stopped new hydro developments, opposed mining, crippled the timber industry, prevented new wood-chip developments and will probably celebrate when their last refinery closes. Tasmanians get their electricity mainly from hydro assets created long ago by their more productive ancestors. But recently a long drought caused a shortage of Tasmanian hydro-energy - they became reliant for up to 40% of their electricity needs on the Bass-link undersea cable bringing electricity from reliable coal-fired stations in Victoria and NSW. However the overloaded Bass Link cable failed, and an old gas-powered station was brought back into service (importing gas from Victoria) to keep the lights on. Subsequently their politicians hurriedly put 150 diesel generators in their shed (costing A$11 million per month). South Australia is the next greenest state in Australia, hosting about 35% of Australia‚Äôs wind turbines. These were force-fed into existence by mandatory green energy targets and tax benefits. In a burst of green destruction they also closed their gas-fired power stations and demolished their coal-fired station. However wind power failed recently and a storm tore down their life-line bringing reliable coal power from Victoria. Now Premier Weatherill is planning to install up to 200 megawatts of diesel generators in his shed. Many residents are following his lead. As some wag said: Question: ‚ÄúWhat did South Australians have before candles?‚Äù Answer: ‚ÄúElectricity‚Äù. The UK has been badly infected by the green energy virus. Engineers warned that this intermittent and unpredictable supply had increased the risk of blackouts, so the UK government offered subsidies for emergency backup power. This subsidy, plus consumer concerns, put so many diesels in British sheds that they now provide a major backup capacity for UK electricity. Many Spaniards found a diesel in the shed was very profitable. Their government had been drinking green-ale and offered attractive subsidies for solar power produced. The subsidy was very successful - so successful that someone eventually noticed that some suppliers were even producing ‚Äúsolar‚Äù power at night. It was coming from diesels in their sheds. Finally, our green media likes to feature some green energy enthusiast who is ‚Äúoff the grid‚Äù. But it usually emerges later in the show that there is a diesel in their shed too. Those who remember the days of relying on a noisy smelly diesel in the shed and a smoky wood stove in the kitchen have no wish to be dragged back there by green zealots.

See here or here 25 April, 2017 Warmists have just lost the Antarctic peninsula The peninsula was the only bit of the Antarctic that suited the Warmists. They gleefully reported glacial breakups there, quite ignoring that the Antarctic as a whole was certainly not warming and was in fact tending to cool. The study below however shows that the warmer period on the peninsula was an atypical blip that has now reversed Recent regional climate cooling on the Antarctic Peninsula and associated impacts on the cryosphere M. Oliva et al. Abstract The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is often described as a region with one of the largest warming trends on Earth since the 1950s, based on the temperature trend of 0.54 ¬∞C/decade during 1951‚Äì2011 recorded at Faraday/Vernadsky station. Accordingly, most works describing the evolution of the natural systems in the AP region cite this extreme trend as the underlying cause of their observed changes. However, a recent analysis (Turner et al., 2016) has shown that the regionally stacked temperature record for the last three decades has shifted from a warming trend of 0.32 ¬∞C/decade during 1979‚Äì1997 to a cooling trend of ‚àí 0.47 ¬∞C/decade during 1999‚Äì2014. While that study focuses on the period 1979‚Äì2014, averaging the data over the entire AP region, we here update and re-assess the spatially-distributed temperature trends and inter-decadal variability from 1950 to 2015, using data from ten stations distributed across the AP region. We show that Faraday/Vernadsky warming trend is an extreme case, circa twice those of the long-term records from other parts of the northern AP. Our results also indicate that the cooling initiated in 1998/1999 has been most significant in the N and NE of the AP and the South Shetland Islands (> 0.5 ¬∞C between the two last decades), modest in the Orkney Islands, and absent in the SW of the AP. This recent cooling has already impacted the cryosphere in the northern AP, including slow-down of glacier recession, a shift to surface mass gains of the peripheral glacier and a thinning of the active layer of permafrost in northern AP islands.

Volume 580, 15 February 2017, Pages 210‚Äì223 \\nThe coming British election: These are the great unmentionables of this election As usual when another election comes along, I try to point out some of those hugely important issues which won‚Äôt be getting discussed, because all the parties agree not to notice them. High on the list is the energy future we face under the Climate Change Act, where our politicians have all happily nodded through a ‚Äúdecarbonisation‚Äù policy whereby we shall before long be phasing out all those remaining fossil-fuel power stations which still provide more than half our electricity, to rely instead on grotesquely subsidised ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù and imaginary nuclear power stations which show little sign of getting built. Scarcely any MP has yet shown any sign of recognising what a disaster this is heading us for. The only mentions it is likely to get in coming weeks will be virtue-signalling manifesto references to the need for yet more unreliable renewables. SOURCE \\nGreen Energy Poverty Week A week dedicated to topics that underscore impacts environmentalists don‚Äôt want to discuss Paul Driessen April 22 was Earth Day, the March for Science and Lenin‚Äôs birthday (which many say is appropriate, since environmentalism is now green on the outside and red, anti-free enterprise on the inside). April 29 will feature the People‚Äôs Climate March and the usual ‚ÄúClimate change is real‚Äù inanity. The Climate March website says these forces of ‚ÄúThe Resistance‚Äù intend to show President Trump they will fight his hated energy agenda every step of the way. Science March organizers say they won‚Äôt tolerate anyone who tries to ‚Äúskew, ignore, misuse or interfere with science.‚Äù After eight years of government policies that killed jobs and economic growth ‚Äì and skewed, ignored, misused, obstructed, vilified and persecuted science and scientists that strayed from alarmist talking points, to advance a climate chaos, anti-fossil fuel, anti-growth agenda ‚Äì that piety is arrogant hypocrisy. But their theater of the absurd gets worse. Some March for Science leaders were outraged that the recent MOAB bomb dropped on ISIS terrorists shows ‚Äúhow science is weaponized against marginal people.‚Äù The rhetoric also recalls the annual Earth Hour, when people in rich countries are supposed to turn off their lights for 60 minutes, to repent for the sin of using fossil fuel, nuclear and hydroelectric power to electrify our homes, businesses, schools and hospitals. I personally promote Human Achievement Hour, by turning on extra lights, to celebrate humanity‚Äôs incredible innovations and advancements these past 150 years, our modern living standards, and the right of all people to improve their lives and life spans. I was a campus organizer for the very first Earth Day, in 1970, when we had serious pollution problems. But since then we‚Äôve cleaned up our act, air and water. Environmentalist groups, modelers and Obama regulators ignore these advances, real climate science and the Real-World climate outside their windows. Far worse, while claiming to care deeply about the poorest among us, they ignore the harm their policies inflict: soaring electricity prices, fewer jobs, lower living standards in the West ‚Äì and perpetual poverty, disease, malnutrition and premature death in developing countries. We pay more and more each year for de minimis further improvements in environmental quality, combined with ever-expanding government and activist control of our lives, and steadfast opposition to reliable, affordable energy in the Third World. That‚Äôs why some folks who actually care about poor, minority, elderly, working class and developing country families again designated April 17-23 as Green Energy Poverty Week. For industrialized nations, ‚Äúgreen energy poverty‚Äù refers to households in which 10% or more of family incomes is spent on natural gas and electricity costs ‚Äì due to policies that compel utilities to provide ever increasing amounts of expensive, less affordable, politically preferred ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy. It‚Äôs a regressive tax that disproportionately affects low and fixed income families which have little money to spend beyond energy, food, clothing, rent and other basic needs. Every energy price increase hammers them harder. Beyond our borders, the concept underscores the lot of families that enjoy none of the living standards we take for granted. They have no electricity or get it a few hours a week at random times, burn wood and dung for cooking and heating, and spend hours every day collecting fuel and hauling filthy water from miles away. Corrupt, incompetent governments and constant pressure from callous environmentalist pressure groups in rich countries perpetuate the misery, joblessness, disease, starvation and early death. In the United States, green energy policies affect the poorest households three times more than the richest households. In fact, rising electricity prices affect all goods and services, for all electricity users: homes, offices, hospitals, schools, malls, farms and factories. With 37 million American families earning less than $24,000 per year after taxes, and 22 million households taking home less than $16,000 post-tax, it‚Äôs pretty obvious why wind and solar mandates are unfair, unsustainable and inhumane. Unbelievably, one million mild-weather California households now live in green energy poverty, the Manhattan Institute reports. In fact, the once-Golden State now has the USA‚Äôs highest poverty rate, thanks largely to government requirements that one-third of the state‚Äôs electricity must come from ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù sources by 2020, and one-half by 2030. No wonder California‚Äôs rising rates are already nearly double those in Kentucky and other states that use coal and natural gas to generate electricity. Tesla electric cars also reward wealthy buyers: with free charging stations, access to HOV lanes, and up to $10,000 in combined tax rebates. They require batteries made from lithium dug out under horrendous or nonexistent environmental, health, safety and child labor rules in Africa. The batteries cost $325 per kilowatt-hour ‚Äì equal to $350 per barrel for oil (seven times the April 2017 $50.40-a-barrel price). Spreading California policies across the United States would send the cost of heat, lights, AC, internet, and all goods and services soaring. Jobs would disappear, living standards decline, depression rates increase, drug and alcohol abuse climb, and more people die from poor health, drugs and suicide. Over in Europe, electricity prices are double California‚Äôs current rates: 30-45 cents per kWh! Green energy policies are hammering jobs, industries, healthcare, family budgets and future prospects. British families pay ‚Äúa whopping 54% more‚Äù for electricity than average Americans. Nearly 40% of UK households are cutting back on food and other essentials, to pay for electricity. One in three UK families struggles to pay energy bills. Up to 24,000 elderly Brits die from illness and hypothermia each winter, because they cannot afford proper heat; many are forced to choose between heating and eating. In Germany, 330,000 families had their electricity cut off in 2015, because they could not pay soaring bills. In Bulgaria, 50% of average household income is spent on energy. Greeks are cutting down trees in protected forests because they cannot afford heating oil; hundreds of thousands of acres are being destroyed across Europe for the same reason. A tenth of all EU families are now in green energy poverty. It‚Äôs infinitely worse for billions of parents and children in Earth‚Äôs poorest regions. In Africa, India and other impoverished regions, more than two billion people still burn firewood, charcoal and dung for cooking. Millions die from lung infections caused by pollution from these open fires, millions more from intestinal diseases caused by bacteria-infested food and water, more millions because medicines are spoiled and healthcare is primitive in clinics that don‚Äôt have electricity, refrigeration or window screens. In Uganda, ‚Äúentrepreneurs‚Äù burned a village down, killing a sick child in his home, to turn the area into new forest so that the country could claim carbon credits to prevent climate change. Chad‚Äôs government banned charcoal, the mainstay for cooking in that nation, out of absurd concerns about climate change. Africa‚Äôs desperate families hunt and cook anything that walks, crawls, flies or swims, endangered or not. They have cut down trees and brush for miles around cities and villages ‚Äì turning cheetah and chimpanzee habitats into firewood and charcoal. Poverty is undeniably the worst environmental pollutant. For the wealthy and increasingly powerful radical environmentalist movement, it is no longer about addressing real pollution problems, protecting the environment or improving human health. As UN climate officials have proudly proclaimed, it‚Äôs really about ending fossil fuel use and capitalism, redistributing the world‚Äôs wealth, and controlling people‚Äôs livelihoods, living standards and liberties. Of course, it‚Äôs all meant to save people and planet ‚Äì from exaggerated or fabricated climate cataclysms and resource depletions. But ponder the Real-World consequences during Green Energy Poverty Week. Environmentalists profess to care deeply about America‚Äôs and the world‚Äôs poor and middle classes. But their policies and actions too often speak far more loudly than their words. We might be forgiven for asking, With friends and protectors like these, do the world‚Äôs poor really need enemies?

The pack is thick first year ice (four feet thick or more in places) and embedded with icebergs of much older, thicker ice. The ice packed along the northern shore of Newfoundland is hampering fishermen from getting out to sea and is not expected to clear until mid-May. The same day that the above satellite image was taken (19 April), at the north end of the Strait on the Newfoundland side, a polar bear was spotted in a small community northwest of St. Anthony (marked below, ‚ÄúWildberry Country Lodge‚Äù at Parker‚Äôs Brook). It‚Äôs on the shore of north-facing Pistolet Bay on the Great Northern Peninsula, near the 1000 year old Viking occupation site of L‚ÄôAnse aux Meadows. There were no photos of the Parker‚Äôs Brook bear but lots of others have been taken this year of almost a dozen seen along Newfoundland shorelines since early March: see my recently updated post, with an updated map of reported sightings. Harp seals are now abundant in the pack ice of southern Davis Strait, providing polar bears with an ample source of food when they need it most and therefore, a strong attractant to the area.

The inaugural festivities (organized in part by then hippie and now convicted murderer Ira Einhorn) predicted death, destruction and disease unless we did exactly as progressives commanded.

See here or here 24 April, 2017 Solar ovens and sustained poverty for Africa African families and hospitals cannot rely on limited solar power, instead of electricity Steven Lyazi Solar technology in Africa, including my country of Uganda, would bring good news to millions of people who today must use firewood, charcoal and dung for cooking. Millions of Africans die from lung infections caused by breathing fumes from these fires, millions more from eating spoiled food, drinking contaminated water and having spoiled medicines, because we don‚Äôt have electricity, sanitation or refrigeration. What we do have in abundance is extensive, sustained poverty. Solar technologies could help Africa, because this multi-purpose energy can cook food, light homes, charge cell phones and even power tiny refrigerators. Even simple solar ovens can help reduce our deadly traditional ways of cooking. Renewable energy from wind turbines can deliver even more electricity to billions around the world who still don‚Äôt have this amazing, essential energy. Those are huge benefits, and I applaud them. In addition, we can install little wind and solar systems faster than we can build big power plants and transmission lines to remote areas. However, we must not look at wind and solar as anything more than short-term solutions to fix serious, immediate problems. They do not equal real economic development or really improved living standards. Our cities need abundant, reliable electricity, and for faraway villages wind and solar must be only temporary, to meet basic needs until they can be connected to transmission lines and a grid. Only in that way can we have modern homes, heating, lighting, cooking, refrigeration, offices, factories, schools, shops and hospitals ‚Äì so that we can enjoy the same living standards people in industrialized countries do (and think is their right). We deserve the same rights and lives. That is why I react strongly to people and organizations that think wind and solar electricity and solar ovens should be enough, or the end of our progress, and everyone should be happy that their lives have improved a little. I do not accept that. But I see it all the time. At least a dozen companies are selling solar ovens and other solar technologies in Uganda. There‚Äôs Blazing Tube Solar from Hawaii and Home Energy Africa, which sells Dutch products. Green Energy Africa is registered in Kenya. It says its renewable energy systems ‚Äúprovide electricity without depleting the earth‚Äôs limited resources.‚Äù (Of course, those systems generate very limited electricity and require raw materials that are limited in quantity and must be dug out of the earth and turned into products using fossil fuels. But we‚Äôre not supposed to think about that.) There‚Äôs also Solar point Uganda Limited, Energy Made in Uganda, New Age Solar Technologies Ltd, New Sun Limited, Solar Assembly Plant for African Villages, and other companies. Some just want to make money, and leave. Others plan to stay for years. They can help solve some of our electricity, cooking and indoor air pollution problems. But these are all just short-term solutions. We need real energy, real electricity ‚Äì a lot of it, reliable and affordable. What we are offered is very different. I watched a Blazing Tube Solar demonstration and asked some questions. Their system has a long shiny metal trough that holds a tube filled with vegetable oil. The hot oil heats up a small oven at the top, to bake bread and cook other food. It has handles and wheels, so it can be moved easily. The cooker is mostly metal, so it should last a long time. But it can take 45 minutes to boil some eggs, and it costs $260. Most African village families live on a couple dollars a day and can hardly afford food for their children. They cannot afford $260, or even $100 for some other systems. So they watch the sales presentations and admire the cookers. But they are frustrated or angry that they cannot afford them. I saw this when I traveled to the northern, eastern and central parts of Uganda. Another problem is the sunlight. Even in Uganda, which is on the equator, the best sun comes from October through February. Other times of the year, it‚Äôs not as good because of clouds and rains. So the solar companies mostly come around when the sun is best and their ovens perform the best. When it‚Äôs cloudy for several days, families cannot cook at all, unless they have solar cookers that actually run on electricity from photovoltaic panels on their homes. But those systems are even more expensive, and the battery power only lasts a couple days. Then families have to go back to wood, charcoal and dung. (Small diesel generators would be a huge improvement, but they too are unaffordable for most.) Parents are very aware of the deadly respiratory diseases. But they have no choice. And many just prefer the cheaper traditional means of cooking and surviving than the fancy, expensive solar innovations. A major local preacher for solar energy stoves is a Ugandan native who now resides in Chicago, Mr. Ron Mutebi. He used part of the $100,000 he won at the African Diaspora Marketplace competition at an Africa Infrastructure Conference in Washington. The conference was sponsored by the Corporate Council on Africa, Western Union, USAID and President Obama‚Äôs Forum with Young African Leaders. Mr. Obama often said Africans should use wind, solar and biofuel energy instead of fossil fuels. But I worry that Mr. Mutebi has forgotten how many people are starving, have no money, try to earn a living by digging metal ores with their hands, and almost have to feed their children with grass and dirt. Uganda‚Äôs New Vision newspaper recently reported that over 10 million Ugandans in seven districts are starving and many animals are dying of hunger. This sustained poverty and starvation cannot continue. Many people also don‚Äôt know that Africa has some big dreams. One is a Trans East Africa railway that will link Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Horn of Africa countries. This will be a first of its kind electric railway, some 750 kilometers (466 miles) long, and it will need tremendous amounts of energy that cannot come from wind turbines and solar panels. It will have to come from nuclear power plants ‚Äì or coal or natural gas generating plants. Africa has these resources in great abundance. But so far we are barely developing or using them, except maybe to export oil to wealthy nations. We should use them. Right now, most of our natural gas from oil fields is just burned and wasted right there. Why not build gas pipelines to power plants to generate electricity for millions? Why not build nuclear and coal plants, and hydroelectric projects like the Bujagali and Karuma Dams on the Nile River in Uganda? Mostly because powerful environmentalist groups oppose these projects. They care more about plants, animals and their own power, than about African people. What is an extra degree, or even two degrees, of warming in places like Africa? It‚Äôs already incredibly hot here, and people are used to it. What we Africans worry about and need to fix are malnutrition and starvation, the absence of electricity, and killer diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and HIV/AIDS. Climate changes and droughts have been part of our history forever, and modern energy and technology would help us cope with them better in the future. We must stop focusing on climate change. African governments are not doing enough to build the energy, transportation and communication systems we desperately need. They are not standing up to Europeans, global banks or environmentalists who oppose big power plants in Africa. They need to do better at helping their people. Our leaders also need to remember that Europe and the United States did not have a World Bank or other outside help when they modernized and industrialized. They did it themselves. National and local governments, groups of citizens and businesses, and various banks and investors did it. They invented things, financed big projects, and built their cities and countries. China and India have figured this out. Now Africa needs to do the same thing ‚Äì and stop relying on outsiders, bowing to their demands, and letting them dictate our future. We have the energy and other natural resources, and the smart, talented, hardworking people to get the job done. We just need to be set free to do it.

Electric cars could cause local power shortages if just six vehicles are plugged in to charge on the same street, a leading think tank has warned. Britain‚Äôs energy networks are unprepared for the growing numbers of electric cars and solar panels and ministers must intervene to prevent a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù of ‚Äúrising bills, blackout risk and angry consumers‚Äù, the Green Alliance said. Uncontrolled charging of electric vehicles could cause ‚Äúbrownouts‚Äù at evening peaks in half of the UK by 2023, where the voltage drops and some household appliances stop working.

SOURCE \\nCalifornia again leads list with 6 of the top 10 most polluted U.S. cities All their ponderous Greenie regulations would appear to have had no effect California\\'s smoggy reputation appears to be deserved: Six of the USA\\'s 10 cities with the worst air pollution are in the Golden State, according to a new report. Bakersfield, Calif., again holds the dubious distinction of having the USA\\'s most days of highly polluted air, based on data from 2013-2015, the American Lung Association‚Äôs annual ‚ÄúState of the Air‚Äù report released Wednesday found. In addition to the worst spikes of short-term pollution ‚Äî led by Bakersfield ‚Äî the report also lists the cities with the worst overall year-round pollution ‚Äî led by Visala/Hanford, Calif.‚Äî and the worst ozone pollution, led by the Los Angeles/Long Beach area. California\\'s soaring population and topography allow air pollution to overcome the state\\'s strict environmental laws, said Paul Billings of the American Lung Association. The boom in people brings with it an increase in cars and trucks on the roads, and many of those people live in valley and basins, right where pollution tends to settle. Nearly year-round sunny skies also don\\'t help: Those picture-perfect days are a major factor in high levels of ozone pollution, he added. The state would be far worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal-fired power plants. \"They\\'ve done more than any other state to counteract air pollution,\" Billings said. Overall, the report is a mixture of good and bad news: While year-round pollution has improved, short-term spikes of intensely polluted air have increased. \"While most of the nation has much cleaner air quality than even a decade ago, many cities reported their highest number of unhealthy days since the report began\" 18 years ago, it found. Some 125 million Americans nationwide live with unhealthful levels of air pollution, the report said, placing them at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm. \"Even with continued improvement, too many people in the United States live where the air is unhealthy for them to breathe,\" the report said. Only six metro areas recorded no days when pollution reached unhealthy levels, according to the report: Burlington, Vt.; Honolulu; Wilmington, N.C.; Fort Myers / Naples, Fla.; Melbourne, Fla., and Elmira, N.Y. Billings said he\\'s concerned about Trump\\'s plans to slash the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s budget. \"We have to keep the environmental cop on the beat,\" he said. Trump\\'s budget proposal contains a 31% cut to the agency, including weakening or eliminating the Clean Air Act, which the report says has been the most important tool in the fight for healthy air by driving emission reductions for more than 47 years. ‚ÄúEveryone has a fundamental right to breathe healthy air,\" said Harold P. Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association said.

SOURCE \\nAustralia: March for Science participants hoping to send strong message to political leaders I heartily endorse this march. We do need more science in public life. More attention to the scientific fact that there is no correspondence between global temperature levels and global CO2 levels would be a start Thousands of people have rallied across Australia as part of a global movement calling on political leaders to focus more on science. Crowds gathered in cities and towns including Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, Brisbane and Townsville as part of the inaugural March for Science, which is taking place in 500 locations worldwide. The movement was started by scientists sceptical of the agenda of US President Donald Trump, but Stuart Khan, one of the organisers of the Sydney march, said it quickly went global. He said marchers were calling on politicians to take note that the public wanted policy based on fact. \"The gaps that we see between what science tells us and what we actually see being translated into policy is very large, particularly when you look at things like climate change and the Great Barrier Reef,\" Professor Khan said. \"We\\'re calling on politicians to make laws that are based on evidence that are appropriate for our future ‚Ä¶ Australians want to understand how science and how evidence is being incorporated into policy. \"Disease, famine, communicable disease, pollution of the ocean, climate change, all of these challenges are addressable by science.\" Professor Khan emphasised that the march was not for scientists, but for anyone. \"I\\'m participating as a community member, I\\'m participating as a dad,\" he said. \"It is very important that the March for Science is a community-led march, it\\'s a statement that is coming from the community. \"It\\'s not led by the academics, it\\'s not led by eminent scientists because it\\'s not about them, it\\'s about the community saying \\'This is what is important to us\\'.\" Among the thousands attending the Sydney rally was former Liberal leader John Hewson, who told AM ahead of the march he was concerned about \"the lack of evidence being used as the basis of public policy\". \"I think science is probably more useful and more relevant to society today than it\\'s probably ever been. But there\\'s been a widening gap between science and the public,\" he said. \"We need to stop and recognise the significance of science and the importance of funding it properly and using the evidence that it produces as the basis of good public policy.\" Scientist and Macquarie University Associate Professor Josh Madin attended the Sydney rally with his young family and said politicians needed to pay attention to scientific evidence. \"We do a lot of work on the Great Barrier Reef and we\\'ve seen first hand the devastation up there and I just think there are some decisions being made that don\\'t have the best interests of our children\\'s future in mind,\" he said. Among those throwing their support behind the March for Science is Luke Briscoe, chief executive of Indigi Lab, which works to get more recognition for Indigenous science. Ms Briscoe said Indigenous science, a form of science in its own right, needed to be better understood in Western culture. \"The honeybee dance from where I\\'m from in Kuku Yalanji country in far north Queensland, that dance talks about how the bees are sustaining our ecologies,\" he said. \"It\\'s passing on those customs and traditions that our sciences are embedded in and ‚Ä¶ it\\'s hard to really put value and monetise the importance of that in a Western world.\" Mr Briscoe said having Indigneous participation in the decision-making process would be the only way to ensure better recognition of Indigenous science. \"I think it\\'s important that we ensure that Indigenous voices are heard in the science sector and are at the table in decision-making processes for how we roll out science programs,\" he said. \"In terms of the workforce, making sure that that it\\'s not just a one-way science understanding ‚Äî it\\'s looking at two ways of learning and two ways of teaching science and practicing science.\" SOURCE For more postings from me, see DISSECTING LEFTISM , TONGUE-TIED , EDUCATION WATCH INTERNATIONAL , POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WATCH , FOOD & HEALTH SKEPTIC and AUSTRALIAN POLITICS .

The Leftist \"expert\" on the Middle East (a professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History in the History Department at the University of Michigan), Juan Cole, gets shown up for the know-nothing he is here . And there is another scathing takedown of him here . For more on that see Mark Kleiman . We also read here that Cole thinks Iraq is on the Mediterranean! And if you read here you will see that the wacky Prof. Cole does not even know that a large part of what is the USA today was taken from Mexico! But his identification of CO2 below as a noxious or deadly gas is a low point even for him. Does he realize that he himself breathes out a noxious gas every minute? Cole calls his blog Informed Comment, in the fine old Leftist tradition of calling a thing by its opposite And it\\'s just guesswork that attributes the severity of the Syrian drought to global warming. The Sahara was once lush but went into drought. Was that because of all those ancient Egyptians running around in SUVs when they weren\\'t building pyramids? Climates certainly change but nobody so far has been able to predict it And drought usually goes with cooling, not warming. Warm oceans give off more water vapour which brings rain. So are we saying that the Middle East has been really cool in recent years? Could be UPDATE: I should perhaps repeat here something I noted on 6th: It is true that poor cropping conditions in the Middle East led to food shortages but that was not because of global warming. Why? Because there was no global warming during the period concerned. The drought (roughly from 2005 to 2011) behind the crop failures occurred in the middle of the 21st century warming \"hiatus\". So nothing at that time CAN be attributed to warming. Neither droughts in the Middle East nor anything else can be caused by something that does not exist. The gas attack in Syria on April 4 consumed the world‚Äôs attention and galvanized the Trump White House, leading to the launch of 59 cruise missiles on a small airport from which the regime of Bashar al-Assad has been bombing the fundamentalist rebels in Idlib province. The pictures of suffering children, Trump said, had touched him. Yet the president and most of his party are committed to increasing the daily release of hundreds of thousands of tons of a far more deadly gas‚Äîcarbon dioxide. Climate scientist James Hansen has described our current emissions as like setting off 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs each day, every day of the year. The Syrian civil war has left more than 400,000 people dead, among them graveyards full of children and innocent noncombatants. About half the country‚Äôs 23 million people have been left homeless, and of those, 4 million have been driven abroad (some of them contributing to Europe‚Äôs refugee crisis and its consequent rightward political shift). The war occurred for many complex reasons, including social and political ones. The severest drought in recorded modern Syrian history in 2007‚Äì10, however, made its contribution. The mega-drought drove 1.5 million farmers and farmworkers off the land to the seedy bidonvilles ringing cities such as Homs and Hama. In the northeast, 70 percent of the farm livestock died in those years. These displaced and dispossessed day laborers, who seldom found remunerative new work in Syria‚Äôs stagnant urban economy, joined in the demonstrations against the regime. Some were later drawn into the civil war as militiamen. Others in the end fled their country. A team of scientists found no natural explanation for how rapidly Syria has been drying out over the past century. Of course, Syria has had milder periodic droughts all through history. Moreover, some countries in the region, such as Israel, have been much better at water management than the decrepit Baath state in Syria. It matters how such crises are handled. A team of scientists writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year, however, found no natural explanation for how rapidly Syria has been drying out over the past century or for the withering severity of the latest drought. Human-caused climate change, which has raised the temperature of the planet 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, they concluded, made this Frankendrought as much as three times more likely to happen than if our coal plants, factories, and automobiles had left Mother Nature alone. SOURCE \\nEPA begins Trump\\'s process of weeding out workers The Environmental Protection Agency is moving forward with President Trump\\'s plan to begin cutting staff at the agency by the end of the fiscal year, according to an internal memo. A special task force has been created to oversee the process, with workforce reductions, including an employee buyout program, slated to go into effect by the end of September, according to a memo issued by EPA Deputy Administrator Michael Flynn. \"Streamlining and reorganizing is good government and important to maximizing taxpayer dollars,\" said EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman. \"This includes looking at developing opportunities for individuals to retire early.\" Bowman said it is a process \"that mirrors what the Obama administration EPA did about four years ago.\" It was done \"to ensure that payroll expenses do not overtake funds used for vital programs to protect the environment,\" she said. Flynn sent the memo this week to guide regional administrators and other branches of the agency on complying with a separate April 12 memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The OMB memo \"requires all agencies to begin taking immediate actions on near-term workforce reductions,\" Flynn wrote. \"In light of this guidance, we will begin the steps necessary to initiate an early out/buyout ... program.\" He said the \"goal is to complete this program by the end of fiscal 2017,\" which is Sept. 30. EPA employs about 15,000 workers, 3,200 of whom are targeted to be cut under Trump\\'s budget blueprint. Flynn noted that the EPA would not be ending a hiring freeze at the agency, despite the administration lifting the government-wide freeze this month. \"Given our resource situation, we will continue a freeze on external hiring,\" the memo read, adding that \"limited exceptions to this external hiring freeze may be permitted on a case-by-case basis.\" SOURCE \\nEarth Day and the divestment campaign against humanity The constant warnings about the adverse impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, apart from being utterly inconsistent with the evidence, are similar to the ancient interpretation of destructive weather as the gods‚Äô punishment of men for the sins of Man.

The answer: It is both, so that divestment will be a central theme of Earth Day 2017. Note that current world oil consumption and production are around 98 million barrels per day (mmbd). The International Energy Agency projects global consumption over 103 mmbd by 2040, despite some dubious assumptions. The projection from the Energy Information Administration is almost 121 mmbd by 2040. Even BP and Exxon, driven by political pressures to be politically correct, project global oil consumption and production at 110 mmbd in 2035 and 105 mmbd in 2040, respectively. So the campaign to ‚Äúleave it (fossil fuels) in the ground‚Äù shows few ongoing signs of prospective success. As Pravda in its glory days would have put it: This inverse relationship between government action against fossil fuels and the divestment movement is no accident, Comrade, as there would be no need for the latter were the former meaningful. Let us begin with confusion as a significant but lesser source of the divestment argument, as exemplified here. The argument used to be that high oil prices would suppress demand and thus make many investments in fossil fuel reserves uneconomic. Let me be blunt: That argument‚Äîhigh oil prices make divestment the wise choice‚Äîis rather silly, frankly, as reserves that can developed and produced in the context of high prices are an investor‚Äôs dream. That silliness seems to have dawned on the divestment advocates because their new argument is that low oil prices will make it uneconomic to produce many fossil-fuel reserves. Low prices will ‚Äústrand‚Äù those reserves, that is, make them unprofitable to produce, and those who invested in them will suffer losses. Better for investors to get out now before the coming crash. Note that this argument has been combined with the assertion that international action against (anthropogenic) climate change will reduce investment in fossil fuel reserves: ‚ÄúOil companies must avoid destroying shareholder value by investing in resources that could be forced to the sidelines in a carbon-constrained world.‚Äù Where to begin? It is dangerous to begin a conceptual experiment with a price assumption or change because the price is an outcome rather than a parameter. High oil prices might result from strong economic growth and resulting increases in the demand for energy, in which case the ‚Äúdemand suppression‚Äù assumption would be the opposite of reality. High oil prices, in other words, are not necessarily caused by supply disruptions or by analogous supply conditions yielding a reduction in consumption. But even in that case‚Äîa supply reduction yields high prices‚Äîexisting and new reserves that can offset the adverse supply condition would be viewed as a godsend by the market, which would reward investors in these substitute sources of energy. Similarly, low oil prices might result from an expansion of supply conditions‚Äîfracking and horizontal drilling perhaps?‚Äîin which case some reserves might prove unprofitable to produce, but which must result in an increase in oil output for the market as a whole. It is that overall increase in supply conditions that results in the lower price, which certainly might make some high-cost reserves uneconomic to produce, but which cannot result in an aggregate decline in oil consumption, and which is inconsistent with ‚Äúinternational action‚Äù to ‚Äúkeep it in the ground‚Äù in any case. New discoveries, technological advances‚Äîtell any story you choose‚Äîlow prices resulting from a supply expansion must have the effect of increasing consumption. Let us turn to the malevolence dimension of the divestment campaign, equally confused in ways more subtle, but darker in its implicit but clear anti-human character. The global divestment campaign advertises itself as on a roll, having received pledges from about 700 institutions and 58,000 individuals to divest approximately $5.2 billion in fossil-fuel assets, in particular the 200 or so oil, gas, and coal producers with the greatest ‚Äúcarbon‚Äù content of their reported reserves. ‚ÄúDivest‚Äù is a curious term; a simpler verb is ‚Äúsell,‚Äù and it is a source of some interest that the divesting institutions and individuals are pledging to do so within three to five years. Why not just give the assets away immediately on a first-come/first-serve basis? The obvious answer is that those divesting‚Äîselling‚Äîthe fossil-fuel assets prefer to get the highest prices that they can, an objective rather inconsistent with the purported moral imperative underlying a shift out of fossil fuels and toward the ‚Äúnew energy economy,‚Äù about which more below. For now let us consider the implications of the divestment stance. The fossil-fuel sector is huge‚Äîabout $5 trillion in market capitalization‚Äîbecause other sectors demand energy and fossil fuels overwhelmingly are the most efficient forms with which to provide it. To say that ‚Äúother sectors‚Äù demand energy is to say that people demand it. So if investment in fossil-fuel sectors engenders some sort of moral quandary, does the same principle apply to investment in industries that use energy? After all, they are responsible for the very existence of the energy producers. Will the divestment campaign expand to agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, retailing, the household sector, and all the rest? Is investment in government bonds the only moral course? Well, no: Government too uses vast amounts of energy. And let us not stop there: Precisely why do all sectors demand energy? Obviously, it is because people demand the goods and services made affordable by fossil fuels. Notice that the correlation between energy consumption and household income is high and rises as income increases; for the bottom three U.S. income quintiles, the respective correlations are about 0.75, 0.85, and 0.91. If fossil fuels are evil, so are rising incomes, as the latter drive up the demand for the former. So let us be very clear that one central implication of the divestment campaign‚Äîremember, it is a moral imperative‚Äîis the desirability of poverty as a tool with which to dampen energy demands and thus incentives to invest in fossil-fuel sectors. This is separate from the impoverishing effect of substituting expensive energy in place of conventional energy produced with fossil fuels. Accordingly, the divestment campaign has slipped into the anti-human trap that is the hidden but essential core of modern environmentalism: Far from being a resource, ordinary people are a scourge on the planet. They prefer cheap energy, strongly, but the moral imperative of divestment is diametrically opposed, and investments in people‚Äîeducation, health, etc.‚Äîmake matters worse by increasing human capital and wealth, and thus the demand for energy. Therefore, the moral imperative of the divestment campaign‚Äîits very logic‚Äîleads to disinvestment not only from virtually all economic activities, but also from investments in people, in particular in a third world desperate to emerge from grinding poverty. Consider also one central dimension of what it means to be human: the application of intelligence to overcome the obstacles that define life outside the Garden of Eden. From backbreaking toil by hand to the use of animals and tools to the evolution of energy from wood to whale oil to coal to oil and gas to nuclear power to new technologies yet to be invented or proven competitive, the history of energy is a fundamental component of mankind‚Äôs evolution, reflecting the inventiveness that is uniquely human, a process utterly at odds with the underlying imperatives of the divestment campaign. Supporters of divestment might respond that they too favor inventiveness in the form of the ‚Äúnew energy economy,‚Äù which means such unconventional technologies as wind and solar power. Let us therefore examine the ‚Äúmoral‚Äù dimension of that investment shift. Because unconventional energy sources are unconcentrated, they are expensive and cannot compete without large subsidies and guaranteed market shares. Because they are intermittent‚Äîsometimes the wind blows and sometimes the sun shines, and sometimes not‚Äîthey must be backed up with conventional power units, which must be cycled up and down depending on wind and sunlight conditions. In a word, they must be operated inefficiently, yielding an increase‚Äîyes, an increase‚Äîin the emissions of conventional pollutants. Even an impossible 20‚Äì30 percent decrease in global greenhouse gas emissions would reduce temperatures in 2100 by only about half a degree. Would an enterprising journalist somewhere please ask the supporters of divestment about the morality of a campaign that would (1) impoverish millions of people, (2) increase conventional pollution, (3) yield zero offsetting environmental benefits, and (4) forcibly extract resources from ordinary people, while (5) providing the environmental left with a rationale for moral preening? Despite the constant appeals of the divestment advocates to climate ‚Äúscience‚Äù and their poor use of economic analytics, the reality is that the divestment campaign, like modern leftist environmentalism more generally, is essentially a religious movement. The constant warnings about the adverse impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, apart from being utterly inconsistent with the evidence, are similar to the ancient interpretation of destructive weather as the gods‚Äô punishment of men for the sins of Man. Just as the pagans for thousands of years attempted to prevent destructive weather by worshipping golden idols, so do modern environmentalists now attempt to prevent destructive weather by bowing down before recycling bins. At a more general level, consider the basic theological stance of the divestment campaign: In the beginning, Earth was the Garden of Eden. But mankind, having consumed the forbidden fruit of the tree of technological knowledge, has despoiled it. And only through repentance and economic suffering can we return to the loving embrace of Mother Gaia. Let us not fail to take note of the breathtaking hypocrisy of some members of the current generation of Rockefellers, announcing loudly their decision to divest the fossil-fuel assets of their charity, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, while maintaining a deafening silence about the fossil-fuel investments of the far-larger family investment and wealth management firm Rockefeller & Company. Nor have we heard that they will divest themselves of the lavish lifestyles engendered in past Rockefeller generations by the historical growth of the oil and gas sector. Their central objective is loud applause at the upper-crust cocktail parties for a divestment that will have no effect on the fossil-fuel sector, that will cost them literally nothing, and that is part of a leftist campaign that views ordinary people as a liability. Such are the dimensions of moral cowardice. SOURCE \\nYour Choice: A Green America Or A Brown America BY: ANN COULTER In celebration of Earth Day this Saturday, let‚Äôs review how the Sierra Club sold its soul and screwed the Earth for a $100 million donation. They must hate themselves for it, so why shouldn‚Äôt we hate them, too? After Teddy Kennedy‚Äôs 1965 immigration act began dumping millions of Third-Worlders on the country, the Sierra Club talked of little else besides reducing immigration. In 1970, the club adopted a resolution complaining that the country‚Äôs growing population was polluting the ‚Äúair, water and land‚Äù ‚Äî to the point that ‚Äúour very survival (is) threatened.‚Äù In 1978, the Sierra Club adopted a resolution urging Congress to ‚Äúconduct a thorough examination of U.S. immigration laws,‚Äù noting that the United States, Canada and Australia were the only countries admitting ‚Äúmore than a handful of permanent immigrants.‚Äù In 1980, the club dropped its promotion of birth control, in order to focus on immigration. ‚ÄúIt is obvious,‚Äù the club said, ‚Äúthat the numbers of immigrants the United States accepts affects our population size and growth rate,‚Äù even more than ‚Äúthe number of children per family.‚Äù In 1989, the club‚Äôs Population Report expressly called for reducing the number of immigrants. In 1990, the club‚Äôs grassroots leaders voted overwhelmingly to launch a major national campaign on the immigration problem. Even people who don‚Äôt live in yurts can‚Äôt help but notice the environmental damage being done by hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans clamoring across the border every year, setting fires, dumping litter, spray-painting gang signs in our parks and defacing ancient Indian petroglyphs. The problem isn‚Äôt just the number of people traipsing through our wilderness areas; it‚Äôs that primitive societies have no concept of ‚Äúlitter.‚Äù That‚Äôs a quirk of prosperous societies. The damage to our parks shows these cultural differences. Writing in an environmental journal at New York University, Rosa P. Oakes described the ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù damage being done to ‚Äútowering cactus, Joshua trees, flowering cactus varieties, colorful wildflowers and rock formations‚Äù by illegals. With accompanying photos, she noted that the immigrants‚Äô litter included ‚Äúabandoned vehicles ‚Ä¶ used needles, drug paraphernalia, plastic grocery bags, paper products, empty water containers, blankets, clothing, used disposable diapers, among other things.‚Äù The Mexican cultural trait of littering is apparently well known to everyone ‚Äî except American journalists. As usual, when it comes to anything that reflects negatively on Third World immigrants, you have to be Agatha Christie to get at the truth. If the media can hide Hispanic child rape, it‚Äôs child‚Äôs play for them to ignore the Hispanic littering problem. The best way to find out about garbage being dumped all over by our vibrant recent immigrants is to look at local news stories from any town that contains a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Here are three from last year: Local politicians in heavily Hispanic Allentown, Pennsylvania, wanted to suck up to their constituents by renaming Seventh Street ‚ÄúCalle Siete.‚Äù Then it turned out that the Hispanic merchants on ‚ÄúCalle Siete‚Äù had no interest in this idea. Their No. 1 issue? Litter. Dorcas Derivera, an immigrant from Guatemala, said in perfect English that if politicians wanted to do something useful, they would deal with the litter problem on Seventh Street, which she said she must pick up from the sidewalk before clients arrive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs embarrassing,‚Äù she told a local newspaper. ‚ÄúHow am I going to do business?‚Äù Also last year, in a classic MSM Hide-the-Mexican story, there were media reports of ‚Äúracist‚Äù graffiti targeting ‚ÄúHispanics and African-Americans‚Äù in San Leandro, California‚Äôs Marina Park. Obviously, graffiti directed at ‚ÄúHispanics and African-Americans‚Äù could only have been left by one of those white supremacist gangs so prevalent on ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù! Nope. It was Mexicans, again: The Nortenos, a Mexican gang. By ‚ÄúHispanics,‚Äù the media meant ‚ÄúHispanics other than the ones doing the graffiti.‚Äù Then last October, the parks and recreation department in Decatur, Alabama, was again forced to remove goals from the soccer field because of the mountains of garbage routinely left behind. In the past decade, the soccer games had become ‚Äúan increasingly popular social event among the Hispanic community.‚Äù Would any of this be of interest to an alleged environmental group? It used to be ‚Äî until the early 2000s. That was when the Sierra Club was given $100 million by hedge fund billionaire David Gelbaum in exchange for never opposing immigration again. The club said, How dare you ask us to abandon our principles for filthy lucre! Just kidding! It said, SURE! Did you bring the check? Mass Third World immigration is a triple whammy for the environment because: 1) Millions more people are tromping through our country; 2) The new people do not share Americans‚Äô love of nature and cleanliness; and 3) We‚Äôre not allowed to criticize them. One big advantage of taking white Western European immigrants is that we‚Äôre permitted to complain about their grating cultural habits without being accused of ‚Äúracism.‚Äù (Also, there aren‚Äôt that many of them.) The Sierra Club didn‚Äôt anticipate the PC reasons for preferring non-Third World immigrants, but simply wanted to stop so many people pouring into our country and stepping on the flowers. Which is why the club used to be nearly monomaniacally focused on reducing immigration. By now, it‚Äôs been a quarter-century since the Sierra Club cared about the environment. As is the fate of most groups that stick around long enough, today it‚Äôs just another left-wing, hate-America interest group. Unfortunately, among the things the Sierra Club hates about America are its rivers, mountains, hiking trails, parks and wildlife. Give me your tired, your poor, your empties and pizza boxes, your Cheetos bags, your soiled diapers and abandoned couches ‚Ä¶ SOURCE \\nRENEWABLE ENERGY MYTHS ABOUND By Isaac Orr When it comes to renewable energy, there truly are numerous myths that perpetuate throughout the media and culture that are not supported by any fair reading of the available data. Over the past year ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news‚Äù have become regrettable buzzwords used to dismiss any viewpoint that does not support one‚Äôs own preconceived notions. But when it comes to renewable energy, there truly are numerous myths that perpetuate throughout the media and culture that are not supported by any fair reading of the available data. Renewable-energy advocates often argue that we don‚Äôt need jobs in the fossil-fuels industry because solar and wind have become ‚Äúengines for green and sustainable jobs.‚Äù As evidence, many groups have cited a report published by the U.S. Department of Energy that purportedly shows more people are working in the solar industry than in fossil-fuel power generation. According to the report, 374,000 people are employed by the solar-generation industry, approximately 102,000 are employed by wind, and just 187,000 people are employed generating electricity from oil, coal, and natural gas. On its face, it seems as if wind and solar truly are the job creators and fossil fuels are dinosaurs awaiting extinction. That‚Äôs not the case. It‚Äôs true the DOE report says approximately 374,000 people work in the solar-energy industry, but this number isn‚Äôt just full-time jobs. It includes part-time. Only about 260,000 spend at least half their time working in the solar industry. Economists, to compare competing industries, typically estimate how many full-time equivalent jobs exist or are being created. Unfortunately, the study did not use this metric, and the report is missing citations for footnotes 32 and 33, which are supposed to support their claims about jobs in the solar industry. Another interesting ‚Äúalternative fact‚Äù about the jobs created by wind and solar power is that a large portion of these jobs are construction jobs, the same kinds of positions that were routinely denigrated by renewable-energy advocates during debates about the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. In 2016, 36.7 percent of jobs in the solar industry and 37.2 percent of jobs in the wind industry were construction jobs. All we can truly conclude from the report is solar creates part-time, temporary jobs that come at a massive expense to taxpayers and consumers. Many renewable-energy advocates claim solar and wind are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, but the facts show otherwise. A study from the Brookings Institution found electricity generated from wind costs at least twice as much as coal or natural gas, and solar costs at least three times as much as conventional sources. The only reason the wind and solar industries are still in operation, or were even built up in the first place, is because they receive more subsidies than every other form of energy combined. According to data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2013, wind received $5.9 billion in taxpayer handouts, mainly in the form of the Wind Production Tax Credit. Solar receives $5.3 billion annually, mostly from a 30 percent federal tax credit. Additional federal and state incentives for solar systems make buying these panels virtually free. These subsidies have continued to grow every year. Even with all these subsidies, solar and wind provide just 0.4 and 1.8 percent of the United States‚Äô total energy use, respectively. On the other hand, coal provides 18 percent of total energy use, natural gas provides 28 percent, and oil generates 35 percent of total energy consumption. Wind and solar should be required to compete on a truly level playing field with other forms of energy, which would mean repealing the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar power and the other handouts keeping renewable energy afloat.

This year‚Äôs theme: Government must ‚Äúdo more‚Äù about climate change because ‚Äúconsequences of inaction are too high to risk.‚Äù They make it sound so simple: 1) Man causes global warming. 2) Warming is obviously harmful. 3) Government can stop it. Each claim is dubious or wrong. This weekend at a movie, I was surprised to be assaulted again by former Vice President Al Gore. In a preview, a puffy-looking Gore suddenly appeared, attacking Donald Trump and mocking critics of his previous movie, ‚ÄúAn Inconvenient Truth,‚Äù the deceitful documentary that spreads fear in classrooms today. Yes, teachers play it in class. Now Gore claims ‚Äúthe most criticized‚Äù part of the film was his assertion that the 9/11 memorial site would flood. Then, during Hurricane Sandy, it did! But Gore creatively misremembers his own movie. He had claimed the World Trade Center would flood because of a permanent 20-foot sea-level rise. Actual scientists called that nonsense. It would take hundreds of years for such a thing to possibly happen. But since the area flooded, briefly, Gore spins that as confirmation of his exaggerations. This preview was the first I learned that theaters will soon show a sequel to Gore‚Äôs film. Google tells us that ‚ÄúAn Inconvenient Sequel‚Äù got a standing ovation at the Sundance Film Festival. Trendy Hollywood is so dumb. At least critics who‚Äôve watched it gave it poor reviews. Let‚Äôs go back to points 1, 2 and 3: 1) Man‚Äôs greenhouse gases contribute to warming, but scientists don‚Äôt agree on how much. Of 117 climate models from the 1990s, 114 overpredicted warming. 2) Warming is harmful. Maybe. But so far it‚Äôs been good: Over the last century, climates warmed, but climate-related deaths dropped. Since 1933, they fell by 98 percent. Life expectancy doubled. Much of that is thanks to prosperity created by free markets. But some is due to warming. Cold kills more people than heat. Carbon dioxide is also good for crop growth. Even The New York Times admits, ‚ÄúPlants have been growing at a rate far faster than at any other time in the last 54,000 years.‚Äù But what if Al Gore is right? Maybe our greenhouse gases will eventually cause Greenland‚Äôs icecaps to melt and flood our cities. Shouldn‚Äôt government act now? No. 3) Nothing we do today will stop global warming. The Obama regulations that Trump recently repealed, horrifying the Earth Day crowd, had a goal that amounted to a mere one percent reduction in global CO2. And that was just the goal. Of course, some think any cut is better than nothing. But cuts are costly. They kill jobs, opportunity. All to accomplish‚Ä¶ nothing the earth will notice. If warming does become a problem, we‚Äôre better off if our economy is very strong when the science tells us clearly that action will make a difference. We should be especially wary of expensive government projects given how often alarmists were wrong in the past. As Cato‚Äôs Pat Michaels says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived through eight environmental apocalypses ‚Ä¶ overpopulation ‚Ä¶ resource depletion ‚Ä¶ Silent Spring ‚Ä¶ global cooling ‚Ä¶ acid rain ‚Ä¶ the ozone hole ‚Ä¶ global warming ‚Ä¶ the next one is going to be ocean acidification.‚Äù In the ‚Äò70s, environmentalist Paul Ehrlich won fame with his book ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb.‚Äù Ehrlich predicted: ‚ÄúI would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.‚Äù Oops. Ehrlich now admits: ‚ÄúWhen you predict the future, you get things wrong.‚Äù But he says there‚Äôs a grain of truth in his prediction, because: ‚ÄúIf you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They‚Äôre having all kinds of problems.‚Äù Give me a break. Saturday‚Äôs Earth Day nonsense will include a ‚ÄúMarch for Science.‚Äù The media will hype it, claiming Trump‚Äôs proposed budget will poison the earth. It won‚Äôt. The alarmists claim they‚Äôre marching for ‚Äúscience,‚Äù but they‚Äôre really marching for a left-wing religion. Instead of celebrating Earth Day Saturday, I‚Äôll celebrate Human Achievement Hour. The think tank behind it, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, says Human Achievement Hour pays tribute to ‚Äúour basic human right to use energy to improve everyone‚Äôs quality of life.‚Äù Some ways to celebrate: ‚ÄîUse your phone or computer ‚ÄîDrive a car ‚ÄîTake a hot shower Good idea! Let‚Äôs celebrate progress instead of attacking it. SOURCE \\nFederal Ethanol Policies Make Prairies Go to Seed The prairies of the American Midwest are a vanishing ‚Äúspecies‚Äù of ecological habitat. Although many blame its demise on the rise of industrial civilization, some of the worst culprits are products of the modern state: ethanol subsidies and mandates. As Independent Institute Senior Fellow William F. Shughart II explains in an op-ed for Investor‚Äôs Business Daily, the prairie has fallen victim to massive cultivation of corn for ethanol, fueled by federal policies such as the renewable fuel standard, ‚Äúa congressional mandate requiring refiners to mix renewable fuel (mostly corn-based ethanol) with U.S. gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil products.‚Äù The renewable fuel mandate‚Äîand the federal subsidy to corn farmers‚Äîarose from two concerns: fear of fossil fuels and fear of energy scarcity. The latter arose during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74‚Äîlong before the shale revolution that has unlocked vast reserves of shale oil and natural gas. The former is a by-product of environmentalism, most recently of climate alarmism. Ironically, it has also taken a toll on the environment, including its destruction of prairieland for the sake of corn ethanol. ‚ÄúCurrently, roughly half of the entire U.S. corn crop‚Äîwhich topped more than 15 billion bushels last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äîwinds up in biofuels,‚Äù Shughart writes. Partly as a result, the vanishing prairie now covers only about 5 percent of the land area it once inhabited. ‚ÄúThe ethanol mandate has triggered an environmental disaster,‚Äù Shughart continues. ‚ÄúKicking the ethanol habit should be as much of a no-brainer as buckling up before starting the car.‚Äù SOURCE \\nCoal\\'s Colossal Comeback Buried in an otherwise-humdrum jobs report was the jaw-dropping pronouncement by the Department of Labor that mining jobs in America were up by 11,000 in March. Since the low point in October 2016, and following years of painful layoffs in the mining industry, the mining sector has added 35,000 jobs. What a turnaround. Liberals have been saying that Donald Trump was lying to the American people when he said that he could bring coal jobs back. Well, so far, he has delivered on his promise. There‚Äôs more good news for the coal industry. Earlier this month, Peabody Energy ‚Äî America‚Äôs largest coal producer ‚Äî moved out of bankruptcy, and its stock is actively trading again. Its market cap had sunk by almost 90 percent during Barack Obama‚Äôs years in office. Arch Coal is also out of bankruptcy. It turns out that, after all, elections do have consequences. The Obama administration and its allies, such as the Sierra Club, tried to kill coal because of their obsession with global warming. Regime change in Washington has brought King Coal back to life. Donald Trump pledged to coal miners in small towns across America that he would be a friend to American coal and fossil fuels. As promised, Trump has lifted the so-called Clean Power Plan regulations and several other EPA rules that were intentionally designed to shutter coal plants, which it accomplished with ruthless precision. Hillary Clinton had promised her green allies that she would finish off every last coal-mining job in America. The coal miners weren‚Äôt too happy about this, and her arrogant disregard for a leading American industry that hires tens of thousands of union workers contributed to her losing almost all the coal states ‚Äî many of which were once reliably Democratic. America was built on cheap and abundant coal. Fossil fuels powered the U.S. into the industrial age and replaced windmills and wood burning, which were inefficient, as the primary sources of electricity. America currently has access to 500 years\\' worth of coal ‚Äî far more than any other nation. Despite the last decade‚Äôs war on coal, the U.S. still derives about one-third of our power from coal, making it second only to natural gas. Liberals have argued that coal could never make a comeback, because of cheap natural gas. Clearly, the shale gas revolution ‚Äî with prices falling from $10 to $3 per million cubic feet ‚Äî has hurt coal producers. But economic necessity is the mother of invention, and coal companies, including Peabody, have figured out how to become far more efficient in production. What‚Äôs more, clean coal is here. Emissions of lead, sulfur, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants from coal plants have fallen by more than half, and in some cases 90 percent, in recent decades. The climate-change industrial complex pontificates that the U.S. has to stop using coal to save the planet. But even if the U.S. cut our own coal production to zero, China and India are building hundreds of coal plants. By suspending American coal production we are merely transferring jobs out of the U.S. Renewable energy is decades away from being a major energy source for the world. Until that happens, coal and natural gas will compete as low-priced, super-abundant, domestically produced energy sources for 21st-century America. Nuclear power will, I hope, continue to play an important role, too. Meanwhile, for all the talk of the growth in wind and solar industries, they still account for less than 10 percent of our energy. Almost 70 percent comes from natural gas and coal. Coal isn‚Äôt dead in America. It is unleashed. As a Washington Times editorial put it very well recently, ‚ÄúThe left gave up on the 100,000 coal workers in America more than a decade ago. Donald Trump has not.‚Äù Remember this the next time Elizabeth Warren or Nancy Pelosi lectures us about how much they care about the working class in America. SOURCE \\nALG Foundation releases ‚ÄòShedding Light on Solar Electricity‚Äô Americans for Limited Government Foundation released a report today entitled ‚ÄúShedding Light on Solar Electricity.‚Äù The report covers a number of problems that the solar industry has been causing its customers. It also makes a number of recommendations to state legislators about how to protect consumers and improve transparency in the solar industry. Americans for Limited Government Foundation Director of Research Richard McCarty, who authored the study, stated in the report‚Äôs conclusion: ‚ÄúConsumers have a right to know the facts before they decide to have solar panels installed on their homes. Too many times, unscrupulous solar industry employees have omitted these facts or, intentionally or unintentionally, misled potential customers. That is why state legislators should enact sensible laws that require solar companies to be open and transparent with their potential customers about the advantages and disadvantages of solar panels. Even after legislators address these problems, it will still be necessary for consumers to do their own research to ensure that solar panels are the right choice for them; but until consumer protection laws are strengthened, this research will be even more vital.‚Äù The report covers some of the ways in which solar customers have been scammed as well as problems customers have experienced. For example, some solar customers have not received the government rebates they were due because they were stolen by their contractor. Others have paid deposits on solar panels that were never installed. Many customers have not seen the savings on their utility bills that they were promised. A number of customers who have signed solar leases have experienced problems with selling or refinancing their homes. Those leasing solar panels and trying to get a reverse mortgage have learned it is simply impossible. Of course, all too often, these customers were not told of these risks. To reduce the number of these cases and improve consumer protection laws, the report includes a list of recommendations for state legislators to consider. This list includes requiring solar contractors to provide customers with a written contract; requiring contracts to include the amount of any monthly payments and what, if anything, could cause them to rise; requiring that any promised savings must be written into the contract; and requiring that contracts specify who is to receive any solar incentives. It is hoped that this report will be of use to consumers considering having solar panels installed and to state legislators and regulators concerned with consumer protection. SOURCE \\nWhy This Scientist Won\\'t Be Attending The \\'Science March\\' A much-discussed \"Science March,\" which germinated on the social news site Reddit and then experienced a meteoric rise on all social media in the past two weeks, now has an official date: April 22nd. While a march to support science sounds like a good idea, given the agenda, this scientist will not be attending. I wrote previously of my concern that the Science March would be hijacked by the kind of political partisanship it should instead be concerned about ‚Äì and that has indeed come true. This fear was based on not-so-subtle hints provided by its Twitter feed, such as embracing \"intersectionality\" (a concept taught in classes on feminism) as a core principle. To its credit, the march\\'s Twitter account has stopped dropping hints; now, it\\'s openly stating what its agenda actually is: If you\\'re wondering what this has to do with science, you\\'re certainly not alone. The answer, of course, is nothing. These issues are the primary concern of revisionist historians and social justice warriors, not empirically-minded scientists. The group\\'s updated website* sheds no new light on its cause. The front page is full of trite platitudes, such as: \"We are scientists and science enthusiasts... Our diversity is our greatest strength.\" This screenshot is from the diversity page: It\\'s curious that a website that seeks to include everybody conspicuously left men, whites, and Christians off the diversity list. Similarly, the site\\'s mission statement is odd: The march supports publicly funded science. That\\'s good, but what about privately funded science, where the majority of basic research and the overwhelming bulk of applied research, is done? Non-academic science makes up the vast majority of research in America. According to R&D Magazine, last year the U.S. spent $514 billion on research and development, 64% of which ($328 billion) came from industry. Why don\\'t those scientists count? Despite an enigmatic commitment to \"diversity,\" the march leaves out the majority of scientists. And the private sector is actually far more diverse in science than universities are. Claiming to support evidence-based policies is nice, but it\\'s ultimately hollow if it doesn\\'t specify which policies. Surely, we could learn something about the real intention of the march if we knew who the organizers are. Alas, no transparency is to be found. For privacy reasons, the site won\\'t tell us who they are: In summary: The Science March has now selected a date. But we don\\'t know what they\\'re marching about, who the organizers are, or what scientific policies they support. The only consistent message of substance from the group so far is an insistence on diversity, albeit a version that doesn\\'t include white men or scientists who don\\'t get government funding. Is it too soon to conclude that the organizers never really intended this march to be about science in the first place?

See here or here 20 April, 2017 For the first time in the recent past, human-caused climate change has rerouted an entire river (?) That old apostle of Warmism, Chris Mooney, makes a muckle out of a mickle below. Glaciers advance and retreat all the time. Where is the proof that this retreat is caused by global warming? There is none. It\\'s all just the usual theory and modelling A team of scientists have documented what they\\'re describing as the first case of large-scale river reorganisation as a result of human-caused climate change. They found that in mid-2016, the retreat of a very large glacier in Canada\\'s Yukon territory led to the rerouting of its vast stream of meltwater from one river system to another - cutting down flow to the Yukon\\'s largest lake, and channelling freshwater to the Pacific Ocean south of Alaska, rather than to the Bering Sea. The researchers dubbed the reorganisation an act of \"rapid river piracy,\" saying that such events had often occurred in the Earth\\'s geologic past , but never before, to their knowledge, as a sudden present-day event. They also called it \"geologically instantaneous.\" The process that would ordinarily take thousands of years - or more - happened in just a few months in 2016. The scientists had been to the edge of the Kaskawulsh glacier in 2013. Then the Slims River was \"swift, cold and deep\" and flowing fast enough that it could be dangerous to wade through, lead study author Daniel Shugar of the University of Washington, said. They returned last year to find the river shallow and as still as a lake, while the Alsek, was deeper and flowing faster. Most of the water gushing from the large glacier last year suddenly switched from one river to another. That changed the Slims River from a three-metres deep, raging river to something so shallow that it barely was above a scientist\\'s high top sneakers at midstream. The river wasn\\'t what we had seen a few years ago. It was a faded version of its former self,\" said Shugar of the Slims River, which lost much of its flow due to the glacial change. \"It was barely flowing at all. Literally, every day, we could see the water level dropping, we could see sandbars popping out in the river.\" The study was published in Nature Geoscience. Shugar conducted the study with researchers from six different Canadian and US universities. The precipitating event for all of this happened in summer 2016, when meltwater from the retreating Kaskawulsh glacier burst through a channel of ice, suddenly draining a glacial lake that had fed Slims river and directing waters into a different river that ultimately heads south toward the Gulf of Alaska. Previously, these waters had ultimately fed into the vast Yukon river, which empties on Alaska\\'s west coast. The researchers found only a minuscule probability that the retreat of Kaskawulsh glacier - which retracted by nearly half a mile from 1956 to 2007 - could have occurred in what they called a \"constant climate.\" They therefore inferred that the events in question could be attributed to human-caused climate change. The beneficiary of the change, in hydrologic terms, is the Alsek River, known for its whitewater rafting. It saw far higher flows than normal as a consequence - and empties eventually into the Gulf of Alaska, which should now be seeing a new infusion of freshwater. These events have occurred in a relatively sparsely populated wilderness area, and so will not have ramifications for large human populations - but they give a sense of just how dramatic and sudden climate-linked changes can be. Similarly, recently mountain glacier changes in the Bolivian Andes have created the risk of dangerous outburst floods that could imperil communities below them. The current study represents \"a great example of a threshold response to warming over the last century-and-a-half,\" said Ken Tape, an Arctic ecologist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who was not involved in the research. \"The glacier has been retreating gradually, but at a threshold encountered in summer 2016, the drainage abruptly changed in a matter of weeks and completely reorganised downstream ecosystems.\" Tape cautioned that \"most glaciers, when they retreat, do not have downstream consequences as dramatic as in the case presented here. Flows increase or decrease commensurate with glacier mass balance, but rivers are not usually lost or gained in the process, and change is more gradual.\" The Kaskawulsh glacier, at only 60 degrees north latitude, is in a relatively temperate region well below the Arctic circle, helping to make it particularly susceptible to climate change. The researchers provided measurements suggesting that just before the river reorganisation, the glacier was experiencing quite warm temperatures for the springtime, which seems to have triggered a large burst of meltwater. Shugar said that the researchers do not expect the glacier and the river system that depends on it to flip back - rather, it has entered a new state. \"We did some preliminary estimates of what it would take for the Slims River to be reestablished,\" said Shugar, \"and it seems unlikely to occur in the current climate.\" SOURCE \\nWhite House Floats Excuses to Break Trump‚Äôs Promise to Cancel Paris Climate Treaty This week, White House senior advisers will meet to discuss the future of U.S. involvement in the Paris Climate Treaty. During campaign speeches, President Trump repeatedly promised the American public that if elected, he would cancel U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments to United Nations global warming programs. Since the agreement was signed in December 2015, CEI has made the constitutional, political, economic, and moral case for why the United States should withdraw from it. The Paris Climate Treaty casts a long shadow on America‚Äôs energy producers and job creators as it keeps in place a framework for promoting a regulatory assault on affordable energy and supporting the EPA as the nation‚Äôs unlawful climate legislator. Withdrawing the United States from this treaty would put a stop to Obama‚Äôs attempted end-run around the constitutional treaty process, and ensure that elections, not U.N.-organized, political pressure campaigns, determine the direction of U.S. domestic economic and energy policy. If President Trump fails to do this, domestic and foreign opponents of Trump‚Äôs energy policies and possibly activist courts can continue to invoke this ‚Äúinternational commitment,‚Äù and any future U.S. administration will have free rein to pick up where Obama left off. President Obama negotiated the Paris Climate Agreement to confer a treaty-like status on his domestic climate policies‚Äîoften called the ‚Äúwar on coal‚Äù but effectively a war on affordable energy‚Äîwithout actually going through the treaty process, an acknowledgement that all parties knew would doom such a pact. The ultimate aim of the agreement is to make coal, oil, and natural gas increasingly uneconomical to produce, export, and consume. Remaining a party to the Agreement thus endangers the energy price edge underpinning the U.S. manufacturing renaissance President Trump seeks to launch. Even when Democrats held the majority in Congress, President Obama knew any proposal to adopt new international climate commitments would be dead on arrival. To avoid the Senate‚Äôs constitutional role to ‚Äúadvise and consent‚Äù on treaties, Obama simply claimed the agreement was not a treaty. This end run around the constitutional treaty process is unlawful and reason enough to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Failure to reverse this move, as candidate Trump promised, will entrench a constitutionally damaging precedent, encouraging future executives to avoid constitutional review of unpopular treaties just by deeming them to be non-treaties. Above and beyond the unconstitutional manner of its adoption, the Paris Climate Treaty is inherently toxic to American institutions of self-government. The agreement provides a framework for a global, political pressure machine to exist for decades. The agreement is designed to gin up diplomatic and political ‚Äúblowback‚Äù not once‚Äîas would happen if Trump withdraws‚Äîbut incessantly. The Agreement is designed to organize political protest and diplomatic pressure any time U.S. policymakers fail to keep Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitments‚Äù to de-carbonize the U.S. economy, pony up billions in ‚Äúclimate aid‚Äù for developing countries, and make increasingly ‚Äúambitious‚Äù emission reduction promises every five years, in perpetuity. Failure to withdraw also invites climate policy litigation, because joining the Paris Agreement tacitly affirms the preferred narrative that climate change is humanity‚Äôs greatest peril and ‚Äúinaction‚Äù threatens millions of lives. A Dutch court in The Hague recently ruled that these so-called ‚Äúnon-binding‚Äù climate pacts are no such thing but instead affirm an obligation to impose regulations consistent with their assertions of responsibility to do so. It likely will not be the last to engage in such activism, from which we have no guarantee we are immune. Three ‚Äúarguments‚Äù have been reported in recent weeks as being preferred among White House and administration staff, none of which make any sense. Each argument represents no more than an effort to rationalize breaking President Trump\\'s campaign promise and stay in the Paris Climate Treaty: Avoid ‚Äúdiplomatic blowback‚Äù ‚Äì Except that the Paris agreement actually builds this in as its ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù means of obtaining U.S. submission every five years. The Trump administration can just adjust our (first) promised emission reductions ‚Äì This undermines the concurrent pro-Paris talking point that the United States can just ignore its promise because it\\'s ‚Äúvoluntary.‚Äù The Paris agreement is no more or less enforceable or voluntary than the Kyoto treaty. Membership in the Paris treaty offers an opportunity to argue for more carbon capture and storage (CCS) funding ‚Äì this suggests we should sign the death warrant for the U.S. treaty process in exchange for the prospect of seeking a new subsidy or special interest scheme. None of these new rhetorical inventions is an argument. Each is instead a tacit admission that there is no argument in support of breaking this very explicit campaign promise to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Treaty. SOURCE \\nExiting the Paris Climate Agreement: Scant evidence of expected benefit Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt appeared on ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù April 13 and said, ‚ÄúParis is something we really need to look at closely, because it‚Äôs something we need to exit, in my opinion.‚Äù Why? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bad deal for America. China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030, we front-loaded all of our costs, at the expense of jobs.‚Äù That‚Äôs a good start. It should resonate well with Americans who use electricity at home or work and gas or diesel in their cars ‚Äî i.e., pretty much all of us. But if Mr. Pruitt wants to expand public support, he needs to make six other important points. First, Bjorn Lomborg, accepting climate-change advocates‚Äô assumptions about how much warming comes from carbon dioxide, showed in a peer-reviewed study that implementing all provisions of all signers to Paris would prevent only 0.306 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming by 2100. What would it cost? Unofficial estimates by the United States, European Union, Mexico and China amount to $739-$757 billion per year. Those parties account for about 80 percent of signatories‚Äô emissions reduction pledges. Other pledges would have similar costs per unit, implying something in the range of $185-$189 billion. All told, $924-$946 billion. Per year. Every year from 2030 to the end of the century. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs if the politicians do everything right. If not, the real cost could double,‚Äù Mr. Lomborg said. So, for $65-$132 trillion, we might ‚Äî if the alarmists are right ‚Äî reduce global average temperature by a third of one degree by 2100. That‚Äôs $212-$431 billion per thousandth of a degree of cooling. Second, if carbon dioxide‚Äôs warming effect is smaller than alarmists allege, two things follow: First, there‚Äôs not as much warming ahead to fear. Second, the cooling effect of reduced emissions will be less than thought, and the cost per unit higher. Empirical evidence is mounting that the climate models on which climate-change advocates rely overstate carbon dioxide‚Äôs warming effect. As University of Alabama climatologist John Christy testified before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee March 29, the models call for warming of 0.389 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. But weather balloon measurements find only 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit, satellite measurements 0.211 degrees Fahrenheit and re-analyses of data from major weather centers around the world 0.221 degrees Fahrenheit. Observed warming is about one-half to three-fifths what the models predict. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúclimate skeptics‚Äù who see this. Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel, in an article meant to refute ‚Äúclimate skeptics,‚Äù reported that global temperature has been rising at 0.072-0.144 degrees Fahrenheit per decade ‚Äî one-fifth to one-third the modeled rate. This implies two things: First, carbon-dioxide emissions will drive only one-fifth to three-fifths as much warming as the models predict. Second, implementing the Paris agreement will reduce global temperature in 2100 by only one-fifth to three-fifths what Mr. Lomborg calculated, or 0.061-0.184 degrees Fahrenheit. That raises the cost per thousandth of a degree of warming prevented to $353 billion to $2.16 trillion. That‚Äôs money that could instead be used to provide electricity, drinking water, food, sewage sanitation, infectious disease control, health care, improved housing, expanded industry and other services to help the world‚Äôs poor far more than an imperceptible reduction in global warming. Third, other empirical studies give even more reason to think carbon dioxide‚Äôs warming effect is even smaller. The calculations above assumed that all observed warming 1979-2016 was caused by rising carbon-dioxide concentration. But carbon dioxide is probably not the sole or even primary driver. In a peer-reviewed research report last fall, ‚ÄúOn the Existence of a ‚ÄòTropical Hot Spot‚Äô and the Validity of EPA‚Äôs CO2 Endangerment Finding,‚Äù Mr. Christy teamed up with meteorologist Joseph D‚ÄôAleo and econometrician James P. Wallace III to show that ‚Äúthere is no statistically valid proof that past increases in Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations have caused the officially reported rising‚Äù temperatures. Their analysis showed that, after separating out the impacts of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, changes in solar activity, and the 1977 ‚ÄúPacific Shift,‚Äù no additional warming trend occurred over the relevant period. Consequently, no correlation remained between carbon dioxide (rapidly rising) and global temperature trends (flat except those driven by El Nino-Southern Oscillation). Fourth, that study implies that the ‚ÄúTropical Hot Spot‚Äù implied by computer climate models does not exist. Since that was crucial to EPA‚Äôs carbon dioxide ‚Äúendangerment finding,‚Äù the finding was unjustified and should be reversed. Fifth, whatever the risks from its tiny warming effect, adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere has positive effects. Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. On average, every doubling of atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentration causes a 35 percent increase in plant growth efficiency. Consequently, plants increase their ranges and make food more abundant. The world‚Äôs poor benefit most. One survey of hundreds of studies concluded that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide 1960-2012 added $3.2 trillion in crop yields and would add nearly $10 trillion more through 2050. Sixth and finally, since the endangerment finding was wrong, the EPA should reverse it. There is no reason to call life-giving carbon dioxide a pollutant, and the Paris climate agreement really is ‚Äúsomething we need to exit.‚Äù SOURCE \\nIgnore the Critics: If Trump Withdraws from Paris Climate Agreement, He Will Demonstrate U.S. Leadership Donald Trump made opposition to the Paris Agreement crystal clear during his Presidential campaign. Some supporters of the Paris Agreement are urging President Trump to break this promise. Having other countries know that the U.S. President is resolute is valuable diplomatic currency. In December, 2015, President Barack Obama signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. That signature did not come cheap. To satisfy its Paris commitments, the Obama Administration announced plans to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions anywhere from 26 to 28 per cent below what they were in 2005‚Äîplans that would steeply raise energy costs on American households and businesses and impede job growth. Donald Trump, on the other hand, made opposition to the Paris Agreement crystal clear during his Presidential campaign: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.‚Äù Now some supporters of the Paris Agreement are urging President Trump to break this promise. But they can‚Äôt really argue that the Agreement is an effective way to address climate change; MIT‚Äôs Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change projects that, even if every country followed through with its promises, the Paris agreement would reduce warming by only 0.2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. Instead, the argument is that honoring the Paris Agreement is all about U.S. leadership. As Timmons Roberts and Caroline Jones wrote in a recent Brookings Institution paper : ‚ÄúTo renege on our commitments ‚Ä¶ in support of the Paris Agreement would weaken America‚Äôs ability to muster enthusiastic support on important international policies we might care about.‚Äú This is fantasy. Gratitude is a rare commodity in international affairs ‚Äì just look at the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance recipients. They routinely vote against the U.S. most of the time in the U.N. Those arguing for the U.S. to remain in the Paris Agreement are less interested in bolstering U.S. leadership than in ensuring that they have means to criticize Trump when he fails to follow Obama‚Äôs other ineffectual climate policies. Repudiating the Paris Agreement would be akin to ripping off a Band-Aid ‚Äì a small pain in the form of anger from the U.N. and other governments committed to the agreement, but after that, nothing. How do we know this? Because President George W. Bush lived through discarding the Paris Agreement‚Äôs predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The Clinton Administration signed the Protocol in 1998, despite unanimous Senate resistance. President Bush correctly concluded the Protocol would be ineffective in addressing the problem and impose heavy economic costs on the U.S economy, particularly to the manufacturing sector. Despite strong pressure from the U.N. and European governments, Bush held firm by announcing that he would not ratify or implement the agreement. What was the impact of Bush‚Äôs actions on American leadership role? Foreign governments criticized the decisions, but continued to cooperate and work with the U.S. More importantly, they learned that the U.S. was willing and able to resist diplomatic pressure in order to protect American interests. Having other countries know that the U.S. President is resolute is valuable diplomatic currency, not recklessness. There are broader U.S. constitutional and security interests to consider too. The Paris Agreement is a supplementary agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). President Obama misused the UNFCCC framework to avoid seeking Senate advice and consent for the Paris Agreement under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Conservatives should insist that the President repudiate the Paris Agreement to correct that action alone. But in addition, the Palestinian Authority is a party to the UNFCCC. As was the case when the Palestinians joined the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2011, this event should trigger a U.S. law prohibiting any future U.S. funding to the UNFCCC. The Obama administration continued funding the UNFCCC based on the absurd argument that the UNFCCC is a treaty, not an international organization. In fact, the UNFCCC is a treaty-based international organization, just like UNESCO ‚Äìand the United Nations. So, in addition to the issues surrounding the Paris Agreement, if the Trump administration does not end funding for the UNFCCC in accordance to the law, it would signal to U.N. organizations that there will be no consequences if they grant membership to the Palestinians prior to a negotiated peace with Israel. In fact, to prevent the accrual of financial arrears, it makes sense for the U.S. to withdraw from the UNFCCC, which would also lead to withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. U.S. presidents rarely face easy choices, but this one comes close. Other governments will carp, but withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC would fulfill a campaign promise and send a welcome signal that, unlike the previous Administration, President Trump respects the treaty process outlined in the U.S. Constitution and will stand firmly with Israel. SOURCE \\nPOLL: Americans See Dems As The Party Of Global Warming And Abortion Americans overwhelmingly point to the environment and abortion as two policies areas Democrats ‚Äúdo a better job‚Äù than Republicans, according to newly-released polling data. ‚ÄúMore say the Democratic Party could do a better job than the GOP when it comes to dealing with the environment (59% to 28%), abortion and contraception (53% to 33%), health care (54% to 35%) and education policy (52% to 36%)‚Äù than Republicans, according to Pew Research Center data. Pew reported Democrats were also ‚Äúfavored over the GOP on foreign policy (49% to 36%), immigration (50% to 39%) and government spending (48% to 40%),‚Äù but none of these policy areas had nearly as wide a margin as environmental issues, like global warming, and abortion. The Democratic advantage on environmental issues grew from plus 23 percent in December 2015 to plus 31 percent in April 2017. One reason for this perception could be that Republicans are seen as the party of business and less government, which voters see as incompatible with environmental protection or fighting global warming. Other recent polls suggest Americans are becoming more worried about global warming and air quality with President Donald Trump in control of regulatory agencies. A recent Gallup poll found that half of American adults are ‚Äúconcerned believers‚Äù of global warming, while the other 50 percent of Americans are in the ‚Äúmixed middle‚Äù or ‚Äòcool skeptics‚Äù category when it comes the issue. ‚ÄúThat contrasts with most years from 2001 through 2016, when Gallup found the majority qualifying as Mixed Middle or Cool Skeptics on the issue,‚Äù Gallup found. The percentage of ‚Äúbelievers‚Äù shot up from 37 percent in 2015 to 47 percent in 2016, which rose again in 2017 to 50 percent. Climate scientists declared 2014, 2015 and 2016 the warmest years on record. In regards to air quality, American attitudes are interesting given the air has gotten much cleaner in the last 15 years, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. Though messaging from liberal groups has gotten much more dire on the issue. The Trump administration has made a conscious effort to paint economic growth and environmental protection as going hand in hand. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said in almost every public appearance there doesn‚Äôt have to be a trade-off between industry and environment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been said that you can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too, and I‚Äôll tell you, whoever says that doesn‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre supposed to do with cake,‚Äù Pruitt told Pennsylvania coal miners Friday.

See here or here 19 April, 2017 The Climate Change Speech Donald Trump Should Give (?) U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis is a Republican who has drunk the global warming Kool-Aid. Below he offers a rather clever imitation of a Trump speech in which he proposes that old chestnut, a carbon tax. The only new wrinkle in it seems to be that he proposes to levy the tax on imports only. A small detail he omits to mention is that only 15% of the U.S. GNP is imports so the \"bite\" of the tax would be small. But governments love taxes so that\\'s OK. Any tax is better than none. There is however in the speech not one word about evidence of global warming. Inglis is arrogant enough to think that he doesn\\'t need to prove his case. Since there IS no evidence of anthropogenic global warming his omission is unsurprising. It is as totally political as anything coming from Democrats. We are supposed to take the word of our \"higher-ups\" on important matters Many Trump voters have rejected climate action because they‚Äôve figured that it would grow a government that can‚Äôt be trusted. Donald Trump could show them a small government way to beat climate change. Here‚Äôs how he could say it at one of his rallies: You know that I was joking when I tweeted that climate change is a hoax and a Chinese conspiracy. But it has some truth in it, right? I mean, look at it. American factories gone. China polluting like nobody‚Äôs business. They took our jobs, and they‚Äôre gushing pollution. Meanwhile, Obama wanted to regulate our industries more. Think of it! More! More regulation! Hillary would have done the same thing--even worse. They don‚Äôt get it. They just don‚Äôt get it. Beating climate change means beating the people who are ruining the air. And that‚Äôs not us. It‚Äôs China. It‚Äôs India. Have you heard about their air. They can‚Äôt breathe. They‚Äôre dying. Literally. Dying. We want clean air. Crystal clean air. The best air. The losers said they were going to fix it‚Äîwith regulations. How stupid is that? Regulate more? Industries‚Äîthe few that we have left‚Äîpick up and move from here to there. They go there, and they‚Äôre allowed to pollute. Are you kidding me? We lose jobs, and it does nothing to clean up the air? If we‚Äôre going to do this, we‚Äôve got to make it work for America. AMERICA! Rex Tillerson has told me that he had the best people study this at ExxonMobil. They said the answer is a simple thing. Just calculate the damages that pollution causes, and then price that cost in to the products that pollute. But don‚Äôt stop there. If you do that through a carbon tax‚Äîand that‚Äôs what Rex Tillerson‚Äôs folks told him was the best way‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to give that money back to the people. To the people! Not to the government! If we‚Äôre going to add the cost of pollution to products through a carbon tax, you‚Äôve got to give all of that tax money back to the people. All of it. Every bit of it. And here‚Äôs the best part. China is going to pay. No more of them getting away with taking our jobs and polluting our air. They‚Äôre gonna pay. They‚Äôre gonna pay at the border‚Äîthe AMERICAN border. They‚Äôre gonna pay our carbon tax. China will take us to the World Trade Organization. They‚Äôll say it violates the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. GATT. Wrong. Wrong. My trade people tell me‚Äîand I‚Äôve got the best trade people, believe me‚Äîmy trade people tell me we‚Äôd beat them in the WTO. Imagine that: America winning again. Winning. After we beat them in the WTO, China would have a choice to make. They could keep on paying our carbon tax on entry of their goods into the United States, or they could do their own carbon tax. Either way is fine with us. Either way. If they want to keep on paying our tax on entry, tell them to go right ahead. We‚Äôve got a deficit, and we could use their money. But they‚Äôre not suckers like the losers who‚Äôve been running our government. No, they‚Äôd impose our tax‚Äîour tax‚Äîinternal to China and remit to Beijing. Fine. That would mean that our companies wouldn‚Äôt pick up and move to China. There‚Äôd be no reason to move to China, because they‚Äôd be paying an American-set price on pollution here or there. And we‚Äôd have cleaner air. Beautiful air. The best air. And we‚Äôd have jobs. Companies wouldn‚Äôt be leaving us anymore. We wouldn‚Äôt have the disastrous Clean Power Plan driving them overseas. We‚Äôd be un-regulating, not regulating. This would be the American solution. The AMERICAN solution. There would be no international agreements. No sucking up to the UN. No hopelessly complicated agreements. Just a bold move by the United States. We‚Äôve got the market power to pull this off. We‚Äôre the only country‚Äîthe only country‚Äîstrong enough to beat climate change. All the rest are waiting for us to act. They had hoped that we would be played for the patsies again. No way. No way. This time it‚Äôs on our terms. We‚Äôre going to beat climate change our way‚Äîthe AMERICAN way. We‚Äôre getting rid of the Clean Power Plan. It‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs gone. It was a bad deal for America. We‚Äôre getting rid of cap and trade. It‚Äôs gone. Gone. We‚Äôre going to simply price-in the cost of pollution to products. China is going to pay. And we‚Äôre going to win. America is going to beat climate change. More diplomatically, it‚Äôs a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon tax that‚Äôs GAAT‚Äìcompliant. With negative externalities internalized worldwide, 7 billion customers would drive innovation. America would win. The whole world would win. SOURCE \\nTrump Takes on the Obama \"Climate Change\" Agenda The leftist mainstream media are outraged that President Donald Trump appears to be sticking to his campaign promise to \"cancel\" U.S. participation in the Paris climate accord. The headline in The Washington Post is \"Trump\\'s energy review blocks Group of Seven from consensus.\" Politico\\'s headline is \"Trump\\'s climate demands roil U.S. allies.\" This follows Trump\\'s recent actions to rescind the foundation of Barack Obama\\'s climate change obsession. Once again President Trump is being called a radical, when he is, in fact, restoring common sense to government policy. As Forbes reports, Trump\\'s recent seven-page executive order \"lays the groundwork for rescinding\" Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan, which is currently \"suspended by the Supreme Court while a Washington appeals court considers its fate.\" While Obama was known for his executive overreach (he lost in the Supreme Court more than any other president, including a record number of unanimous defeats), Trump is scaling back government interference in the marketplace that had been justified in the name of battling climate change. \"And so what President Trump did was he instructed the EPA to begin the process, through the regulatory process, of undoing something that should have been done through the legislature but wasn\\'t,\" argues Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Chris Horner in a recent radio appearance. \"This is the meta issue for the left,\" he added. \"It gives them what they have been demanding in the name of so many things, in the name of saving the planet.\" As Horner remarked in a 2010 Accuracy in Media Take AIM interview discussing his book, Power Grab: How Obama\\'s Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America, climate change is \"the latest vehicle to organize society.\" \"The left\\'s objective never changes, that is to ‚Äòorganize society\\' in that creepy Orwellian rhetoric they\\'ve mastered,\" he said. The threat of climate change, thus, is used to rationalize central planning. Far-left activist Michael Moore tweeted in response to Trump\\'s executive order that \"Historians in the near future will mark today...as the day the extinction of human life on earth began, thanks 2 Donald Trump.\" The reception from The New York Times carries similar vitriol; an editorial describes Trump as \"anti-science\" and \"strip[ping] America of its hard-won role as a global leader on climate issues.\" This position as global leader was, of course, earned by former President Obama. The editorial is titled, \"President Trump Risks the Planet.\" The media are overwhelmingly convinced of climate change\\'s veracity-or at least they claim to be-often abandoning objectivity in their reporting in order to defend climate science. The Washington Post defended the Democrats\\' choice to testify before the House Science Committee last month, climatologist Michael Mann, as \"clear and articulate but outnumbered by foes.\" In contrast, the Post reports that at the hearing \"political theater upstaged almost all productive discussion of science.\" The media have been complicit with radical climatologists such as Mann, calling anyone who opposes the climate change agenda a \"skeptic,\" a \"denier,\"-or worse. And it has become popular to compare energy companies to big tobacco, or hype that each year was warmer than the last. This is shaky science, at best. \"The warming trend is over,\" said Horner in 2010. \"It could resume, but it\\'s turned to cooling and is predicted to be cooling for several decades now.\" Horner\\'s comments hold true today. As Marc Morano points out on his Climate Depot website, satellite data indicates that we are in a temperature pause. \"The fact that there has been no warming for the last 18 years is a massive blow to the credibility of climate science,\" he writes. Other scientists point out that there is little statistical difference between the allegedly warmest years and other years: Morano quotes Dr. David Whitehouse as calling 2016 temperatures \"statistically indistinguishable from 2015.\" Claims that we are experiencing the hottest years on record are blatantly bogus, and rely on statistically insignificant temperature changes. Obama\\'s own appointed undersecretary for science in the Department of Energy for the first two years of his administration, Steven E. Koonin, said that \"The Obama administration relentlessly politicized science and it aggressively pushed a campaign about that politicized science.\" ClimateDepot.com is an indispensable website that keeps track of all relevant global warming news, and provides both sides of the debate. One very useful service it provides is the names and quotes from environmentalists, including former \"warmists\"-global warming believers-such as physicist Freeman Dyson: \"An Obama supporter who describes himself as ‚Äò100 per cent Democrat,\\' Dyson says he is disappointed that the President ‚Äòchose the wrong side.\\' Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere does more good than harm, he argues, and humanity doesn\\'t face an existential crisis. Climate change, he tells us, ‚Äòis not a scientific mystery but a human mystery. How does it happen that a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts?\\'\" Then there is Nobel Prize Winning Physicist Dr. Ivar Giaever: \"Global warming is a non-problem,\" he argues. \"I say this to Obama: Excuse me, Mr. President, but you\\'re wrong. Dead wrong.\" He says that \"Global warming really has become a new religion,\" and that \"We have to stop wasting huge, I mean huge amounts of money on global warming.\" Even if the Trump administration kept Obama\\'s commitments to climate change policy, such measures would have been unlikely to affect global temperatures. Yet the media lauded Obama as keeping the world safe from climate change. \"Addressing climate change has been a core goal for the president and netting the Paris climate deal is considered a critical part of his environmental policy legacy,\" reported NBC News and Reuters in 2016, in a piece titled, \"Obama: Paris Climate Accord Best Possible Shot to ‚ÄòSave\\' Planet.\" This is nonsense. It was just another phony Obama legacy item to check off his list that in reality is far more about the U.S. and other developed nations transferring $100 billion per year to developing countries that make no binding commitments. In addition, it would transfer significant regulatory powers to the UN and other international bodies, none of which would amount to anything measurable or provable in terms of tweaking the global temperature to reach some desired environmental utopian goal. According to Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), \"The Paris agreement also created a United Nations climate slush fund, largely underwritten by American taxpayers. In his final year in office, President Obama contributed $500 million from the State Department to this fund on two separate occasions. He did it without authorization from Congress.\" Also, adds Barrasso, \"According to National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting, if the United States met all of its commitments as part of the Paris climate accord, it would cost the American economy $3 trillion and 6.5 million industrial sector jobs by 2040.\" Obama designed his climate agenda in a way that touched each facet of the bureaucracy. \"There is no single list of those programs or their cost, because President Barack Obama sought to integrate climate programs into everything the federal government did,\" writes Christopher Flavelle for Bloomberg. \"The goal was to get all agencies to take climate into account, and also make those programs hard to disentangle, according to former members of the administration.\" Obama, Flavelle writes, tried to make \"climate programs hard for Republicans in Congress to even find.\" To that end, an estimated $77 billion was spent from 2008 through 2013, spread over 18 federal agencies. With this recent executive order, Trump is dismantling another of Obama\\'s key legacy items, a policy that the media desire to protect from the new Republican president. As with Obamacare and the unsigned Iran deal, the test will be to see whether Trump continues Obama\\'s disastrous policies or undercuts them. But you can expect that the media will fight every effort to roll back Obama\\'s legacy.

You couldn‚Äôt avoid reports of unscrupulous lenders and brokers exploiting the subprime market and offering adjustable rate mortgages to people who couldn‚Äôt afford them. As the housing bubble burst, the financial industry and the economy nearly went with it. Facing an economic meltdown, Washington responded as it always does ‚Äî in a frenzy. The first decade of the new millennium ended with a taxpayer bailout (the ill-conceived Troubled Asset Recovery Program) and regulatory overreach (Dodd-Frank Act) ‚Äî the consequences of which we are still paying today. Good times. Well, predatory lending is back. But this time, lenders aren‚Äôt just prowling for green; they‚Äôre wrapped in it under the fa√ßade of environmental ‚Äúdo-goodism.‚Äù This latest scam is the so-called Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) lending industry, which provides financing for energy efficiency or renewable energy upgrades, like solar panels and window insulation. PACE loans are placed on a homeowner‚Äôs property tax bill as an assessment. Rather than make a monthly loan payment, borrowers typically pay the assessment on an annual or semi-annual basis; local governments then pass these payments on to the lenders. Because the loans are based on the value of the assessed property, the borrower‚Äôs creditworthiness is of little interest to PACE lenders. Also, the industry uses as its brokers plumbers and repairmen who pitch financing schemes to customers as a means of soliciting contracts and earning referral fees on the side. Like their predatory lending brethren of the past, these lenders and their contractor-brokers appear to prey on vulnerable and unsophisticated homeowners ‚Äî particularly the elderly. A report by Elder Law & Advocacy, which offers legal services to senior citizens in the San Diego area, cited numerous accounts of misleading tactics being used by PACE lending brokers and sales personnel. One case cited a 79-year old widower who was offered new energy-efficient, noise reduction windows at a 1.5 percent financing rate with no payoff penalty, only to receive poorly insulating, noise amplifying windows ‚Äî at a 26.99 percent interest rate! Another account documented an 82-year old man who was never told that he would lose his ability to refinance his home if he took on a PACE loan. And the horror stories don‚Äôt end there. Complicating matters is the entanglement of government at all levels to promote the PACE lending industry. Local governments in PACE communities effectively serve as the industry‚Äôs collections agency for the payment of assessments, which the government distributes to the lenders. Also, because PACE loans are technically property tax assessments, they generally get creditor priority status in case of non-payment or default. Yes, you read that correctly: in case of default, a loan for residential solar panels gets paid first ‚Äî even before a homeowner‚Äôs mortgage. Non-payment of a PACE loan can result in a home or property being seized as collateral and sold to repay the PACE lender. In other words, you could lose your home, not because you defaulted on the mortgage you assumed to buy the house, but to pay off a loan for solar panels or attic insulation or LED lighting. In 2016 ‚Äî the final year of the Obama Administration ‚Äî the federal government fully bought into the PACE industry‚Äôs lending ‚Äúgreen scheme.‚Äù In coordination with the Obama strategy to promote green industries, the Federal Housing Administration announced that it would begin using tax dollars to insure mortgages with PACE financing liens attached (so long as those liens did not have super priority creditor status). And the Obama-Clinton influence games did not end there. A Washington Free Beacon article detailed an undercover lobbying campaign launched by PACE lender Renew Financial ‚Äî and aided by a deep-pocketed Democratic donor and liberal environmentalist groups ‚Äî to allow mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee mortgages with PACE-financed loans. This would have reversed the policy of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which regulates the government-sponsored enterprises. While the FHFA did not appear to change its policy, the PACE lending industry did get a Presidential plug promoting this high-interest, private lending industry. The meetings with President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and top campaign and government officials came to light through the hacked emails of former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta that were exposed by Wikileaks. Finally, we are talking about big money. While the PACE lending industry paints itself as warm, fuzzy, and green, it is projected to make off with nearly four billion dollars in 2017 alone ‚Äî making it the fastest growing source of financing in the country. That business is booming should come as no surprise, given the industry‚Äôs political influence and the scant level of oversight it is paid by any level of government. This will change on the federal level if Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has his way. Cotton just introduced legislation (S. 838) requiring that PACE lenders be treated under federal law like traditional mortgage lenders ‚Äî including oversight by a federal regulator, such as the much-feared Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. According to Cotton, ‚Äú[R]equiring disclosure will reduce the advantage that PACE loan sharks have over hard-working Americans. It‚Äôs just the accountability we need.‚Äù Measures like the Cotton bill are a sign that the Obama era of political favoritism toward ‚Äúgreen‚Äù industries may finally be coming to a halt. And with good reason: it shouldn‚Äôt be easy being green ‚Äî and greedy. SOURCE \\nVictory in Vermont: Community Defenders Crush Wind Power Outfit‚Äôs Plan to Destroy Pristine Mountain Range Thanks to the hard work of local people, everyday Vermonters who love the land and, in particular, Annette Smith and Justin Lindholm, two people who worked like hell, we have a huge parcel of prime property in which to ‚Äúramble,‚Äù a large chunk of land that, if those people ‚Äúhypnotized‚Äù by profits had their way, the mountain tops of that wild land would forever be marked by the languid swoosh-swoosh-swoosh of 60 giant windmills. Instead, the forested tract of land that totals about 2,870 acres has been designated by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources as a rare and irreplaceable natural area. Fortunately, it is connected to the Bird Mountain Wildlife Management Area, about 770 acres, to bring the new, yet unnamed WMA to more than 3,640 acres. In all, the land that makes up the new WMA encompasses three Rutland County towns ‚Äî Ira, Poultney and Castleton. Smith, the executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said that, in order to preserve the values and purposes of the wildlife management area, no residential, commercial, industrial or mining activities will ever be permitted. ‚ÄúThis is a valuable gem of a property to be held for the public in perpetuity,‚Äù Smith said. Smith said that after the VCE worked with community members to save the land from development, it was conserved through the efforts of the Conservation Fund (Nancy Bell) and Vermont Fish & Wildlife (commissioners Patrick Berry and Louis Porter), along with donations from individuals and the federal Pittman-Roberson Act fund. The Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Vermont Land Trust are also participants in the purchase of the land. So, what is the moral to this tale, this story about how people stood up to preserve what Lindholm, a Mendon resident who serves on the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Board, has described as a precious tract of land that is both ‚Äúfragile and wild?‚Äù Paraphrasing a quote from Margaret Mead, Smith said in an interview, ‚ÄúNever underestimate the impact one person can have. One person can make a difference.‚Äù She went on to say, ‚ÄúThe one thing that Vermonters have in common is they love their mountains.‚Äù She was so instrumental in preventing a series of ridgelines in Rutland Country from becoming littered with windmills that the Burlington Free Press, in January of this year, named Smith its ‚Äú2016 Vermonter of the Year.‚Äù The newspaper‚Äôs editorial board wrote: ‚ÄúAs executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, the Danby resident has organized communities, testified before government boards and advised residents who felt powerless in the face of state bureaucracies and big business ‚Ä¶ A common thread among those who have sought out Smith is that she helps better the odds against a wealthier, more knowledgeable and better funded adversary.‚Äù Lindholm and Smith teamed up early on because both of them had been involved in the proposed large-scale wind turbine project in Lowell. Today, 21 wind turbines, each 459-feet tall, have sprouted from the ridgeline of the Lowell Mountains. ‚ÄúWe learned from Lowell,‚Äù Smith said According to Lindholm, Smith does her homework and then goes after a cause with a fierce determination. ‚ÄúWhen they wanted to put up those wind turbines, she gave them a voice,‚Äù Lindholm said of the landowners and property owners in Ira, Middletown Springs, Poultney, Castleton, Tinmouth, Clarendon and West Rutland who were affected by the wind turbine proposals. ‚ÄúShe gives them a voice in the process, the whole process of figuring out whether they ought to be there. She finds weaknesses in the opposition. She becomes informative. Information is power, and that‚Äôs what she specializes in. She organizes. She organizes the town, informing the people. She puts everything on the table so that informed decisions can be made.‚Äù SOURCE \\nAustralia: Leftist leader\\'s stance on new coalmine doesn‚Äôt stack up Just because you‚Äôre spending other people‚Äôs money doesn‚Äôt excuse you from making choices. Should the government lend $900 million to help lay 189km of heavy rail track in central Queensland capable of transporting 60 million tonnes of premium thermal coal a year? Or would it be better to splash out on a 12km tram line to convey beret-clad Canberrans between coffee shops on Northbourne Avenue? The carbon fearmongerers are implacably opposed to the first option but are crazy about the Gungahlin tram, a green vanity project adopted by the ACT Labor government that will fleece an estimated $937m from taxpayers during its lifetime. It is the type of project that ticks all the boxes for the modern Labor Party, satisfying the romantic yearnings of its progressive base and the anti-competitive tendencies of its union sponsors. Construction work on Capital Metro is effectively a Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union closed shop ‚Äî inflated pay packets, fanciful allowances and abundant rostered days off. Fixed point-to-point transport projects are unlikely to ‚Äústack up‚Äù, as Bill Shorten would put it, in a city with a population 12 times smaller than Melbourne and one of the highest car ownership rates in the country. Even on the most optimistic assumptions the line is expected to generate less than $340,000 a month in revenue across its first 20 years, meaning that for every dollar a passenger pays, the taxpayer will be throwing in a tenner. If there were a prize for egregious public investment, the Gungahlin tram, cruising at a stately 29km/h across broad acres of Canberra‚Äôs median strips, would be hard to beat. Enter Shorten, the leader of what was once called the workers‚Äô party, who raves about public transport but is unsure if the business case for the Adani Carmichael line ‚Äústacks up‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am not convinced the taxpayer of Australia should underwrite the risk of the project through a billion-dollar loan,‚Äù he told reporters in Brisbane last week. Shorten‚Äôs decision to align himself with the fanciful claims of the fruitcake fringe and against the interests of private industry is a seminal moment for the ALP. Labor‚Äôs ideological journey from a socialist party that merely wanted to take over the means of production to a deep green party that wants to close down the whole lot is complete. Construction of the Carmichael mine would boost sluggish regional economies from Gladstone to Townsville, lifting wages and employment. A concessional government loan for the rail link would mean that up to five more mines might follow. Yet Shorten is content to let the green reactionaries triumph and leave the Galilee Basin coal reserves untouched. The interests of the workers are sacrificed for environmental populism. Labor‚Äôs flirtation with the green movement began in the early 1980s when Bob Hawke decided to stand with Bob Brown in opposing the Franklin Dam. It was a popular move on the mainland, where Hawke won the 1983 election with a 4 per cent swing. There was a 4 per cent swing against Labor in Tasmania, however, where the dam meant progress and jobs. Hawke‚Äôs finance minister, Peter Walsh, warned that no good would come from trying to satisfy the insatiable demands of ecological activists. Labor, he wrote in his memoir, had knowingly put Tasmanian blue-collar workers out of work ‚Äúto appease the bourgeois left and middle-class trendoids in the gentrified suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne‚Äù. What Walsh and others did not predict was that the workers would eventually be squeezed out by the middle-class trendoids, just as they were squeezed out from the workers‚Äô cottages in inner-Sydney Chippendale. Nor could anyone have foreseen in 1983 that the kayak-paddling nature lovers blockading the Franklin would spawn a protest industry with a nine-figure turnover, or that demonisation of dams would be eclipsed by the demonisation of coal, a combustible sedimentary rock that gave us modernity. By the mid-1980s, the green movement, radicalised by its own success, was congratulating itself on locking away every hectare of untamed wilderness and was looking for new targets for its righteous anger. The marginal, drought-prone pastures of the Galilee Basin became a cause worth fighting for once the Greens had succeeded in portraying coal as public enemy No 1. The anti-coal campaigners met their match in Gautam Adani, a university dropout from India‚Äôs Gujarat state who set up his own diamond brokerage at 20 and traded his way to become a multi-billionaire. The Adani Group‚Äôs stubborn refusal to let green spoiling tactics stop its plan to open Australia‚Äôs largest coalmine makes its tenacious chairman a true Aussie hero. There is far more at stake in this fight than the fate of one coalmine, just as more rested on the Franklin campaign than the future of one dam. It is a test of strength between ideology and pragmatism, a choice between deep-green dogma and progress. If the environmentalists were to win this fight it would put an effective moratorium on the expansion of coal for the next 30 years, just as Franklin put a stop to large-scale water storage. By refusing to offer material support to the project, Shorten, on behalf of Labor, has effectively thrown in the towel. He presumes to know better than private sector investors prepared to risk billions of dollars of their own capital in the project by declaring that the project doesn‚Äôt stack up. He is prepared to fight Malcolm Turnbull over the allocation of money from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility, controlled by an independent board charged with offering concessional loans to projects that pass a public interest test on which they can reasonably expect a return. In his 2016 book, For the Common Good, Shorten dismissed the future of thermal coal and instead declared his ambition to make Australia a ‚Äúclean energy superpower‚Äù. The growth in mining exports is fading, he declared. Renewable energy is ‚Äúthe biggest business opportunity in the history of business‚Äù, and Labor, in time, will be shown to be ‚Äúon the right the side of history‚Äù. Now that Shorten has revealed his intention to put the kybosh on Adani, the portent of his extravagant rhetoric is a little less opaque.

It is now the wettest year on record in the Northern California mountains, National Weather Service officials said Thursday. An index of precipitation at eight sensors showed that just under 90 inches of rain and snow have fallen this winter in the northern Sierra Nevada. The previous record of 88.5 inches was set in the winter of 1982-1983. The average for the region is 50 inches a year, according to the state Department of Water Resources. The record was surpassed less than a week after Gov. Jerry Brown officially declared an end to California‚Äôs drought emergency ‚Äî a largely symbolic pronouncement that left in place some water-conservation rules for the 40 million residents of the nation‚Äôs most populous state. More snow and rain is likely to pad the record before the wet season ends. A winter weather advisory was in effect for the northern Sierra for much of Thursday with forecasts for moderate to heavy snow along with rain at lower elevations. More storms were forecast for next week. The measurements were taken from sensors spread from Mount Shasta near the Oregon border to Pacific House between Sacramento and South Lake Tahoe. Winter storms have blanketed mountains in snow, flooded urban areas and caused damage that could top $1 billion. The weather also taxed reservoirs, dams and levees designed to control floods and capture winter rain and snow for agriculture and drinking water throughout the state. The five sensors that make up the San Joaquin region have recorded 68.2 inches of rain ‚Äî almost double the average for this time of year and roughly on pace with the 1983 record of 77.4 inches, according to the Water Resources Department. SOURCE \\nThis Isn\\'t A March For Science This Is About Economic And Political Policy One of those who organises the Union of Concerned Scientists has penned an explanation of the March for Science to take place next weekend. And it\\'s entirely obvious that what he\\'s actually irate about isn\\'t science at all, it\\'s the political and economic policies being put in place as a result of science that irks him. The two are not the same thing, not the same thing at all: \"So, why are they grabbing placards now? Because an unprecedented attack on science, scientists and evidence-based policymaking is underway in the US federal government.\" An attack upon science or the scientific method would be worthy of a march of course. But that really just isn\\'t what is being complained about: \"Nowhere is the attack more ferocious than on the issue of global warming, where the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the modest but important policies put in place by President Obama.\" Ah, no, that\\'s not a complaint about science at all is it? That\\'s a complaint about political and economic policy. Good economic policy tells us that the political action to deal with climate change should not be what Obama has been doing. Reversing those regulations is not thus an attack on science it\\'s an attack on bad policy. And do please note that this is true whatever we think of climate science itself. The truth of emissions causing warming has no influence at all upon the best method of reducing emissions and thus warming: \"My organisation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, with its more than 500,000 members and supporters, has joined with allies from the climate, environmental justice and labour movements to help organise both the March for Science and the People‚Äôs Climate March.\" Again, that\\'s not about science. That\\'s about economic and political policies. There\\'s a much deeper point here too. Let\\'s say that we really do want to be ruled by science. Personally, I don\\'t think so, the people who tried scientific socialism didn\\'t give that sort of thing a good name really. But let\\'s say that we do want to be. OK, so, each scientist is an expert in their really rather small part of the overall endeavour. I know someone, in fact have funded some of her work, who is the world\\'s great expert on the extraction of rare earth metals from the wastes of bauxite processing. Excellent--that doesn\\'t mean that she\\'s therefore who I would turn to on how competition policy should be crafted so as to ensure rare earth supply for the US military, just to mention something that is doing the rounds at present. Similarly I\\'m absolutely delighted to take the word of that guy measuring atmospheric CO2 in Hawaii. That doesn\\'t mean that he\\'s going to be expert in how to change human behaviour in order to get that number going down again. For we\\'ve another scientific specialty which deals with those sorts of things--economics. That\\'s what it is about, the allocation of scarce resources so as to meet humans wants and desires. And thus if we want to change the way that humans are allocating resources then that\\'s the science we\\'re going to have to use. It\\'s worth noting that pretty much all economists are against those uses of regulation to control emissions. Not because they don\\'t believe or trust the climate scientists. But because the economists have their own expertise. Not in climate science of course--but in what you need to do to get humans to change their behaviour. And that\\'s the real point here. The complaint which is driving the march isn\\'t about an attack on science at all. Far from it, it\\'s one group of scientists not understanding that the policy they advocate is, by the scientific experts in the policy, considered to be a bad one which should be replaced. If you like, this is the Union of Concerned Scientists not quite understanding that it is economics which is the science of what we do about things.

An agency library in Las Vegas, Nevada, bought 37 employees one-year memberships to the gym 24 Hour Fitness, according to a receipt obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The \"super sport\" memberships cost $399.99 each. The employees work at the U.S. Environmental Science Division located at 944 East Harmon Ave. in Las Vegas. The address is home to the EPA\\'s National Exposure Research Laboratory and a library on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) campus, which EPA scientists, postdoctorate researchers, and contractors use for research. The receipt for \"fitness memberships for EPA employees\" totaled $14,799.63 and was created in April 2016. The 24 Hour Fitness memberships include yoga and martial arts classes. The gym boasts \"good vibes\" where EPA employees can \"sweat it out together.\" The taxpayer funding for gym memberships comes at a time when numerous EPA employees are upset with President Trump\\'s proposed budget, which would reduce the EPA\\'s annual funding to $5.7 billion. Employees were coming to work in tears months after Trump\\'s presidential victory. Recently, unionized EPA employees participated in \"resistance\" rallies on Capitol Hill. The EPA office opted to purchase the expensive memberships from 24 Hour Fitness instead of utilizing the gym on UNLV\\'s campus. The agency leases five buildings from the university. The university has a 184,000-square-foot Student Recreation and Wellness Center that is available to EPA employees for $25 per month. The campus gym includes a \"state-of-the-art\" relaxation room with massage chairs, fitness assessments, personal trainers for hire, a registered dietician, a spa and leisure pool, indoor jogging, and a \"gender neutral bathroom.\" Instead, the agency opted to bill taxpayers $400 per person. Request for comment from the EPA library and the Environmental Science Division were not immediately returned.

Five major shareholders including the powerful California State Teacher‚Äôs Retirement System (Calstrs) wrote to Mr Musk at the start of the week to raise concerns about Tesla‚Äôs directors, highlighting the personal or professional links they have with the entrepreneur. The letter came just days after Tesla overtook Ford as the most valuable US car company, when it market value hit almost $49bn, compared with Ford‚Äôs $45bn. This was despite Ford delivering 6.6m cars last year, compared with Tesla‚Äôs 76,000. Hopes that Tesla\\'s electric vehicles will dominate future transport have since seen the shares climb as high as $312 since then, pushing the company\\'s value to beyond $50bn. However, Mr Musk - who owns about a fifth of Tesla\\'s shares - took exception at the letter from investors, tweeting in reply to a news report that ‚ÄúThis investor group should buy Ford stock.

The study‚Äôs author, biologist and writer Tim Low, said green groups that put all their efforts into trying to halt environmental degradation would get more benefit per dollar spent from worrying about stopping the next lantana or cane toad as well. ‚ÄúAustralians think they‚Äôve got the world‚Äôs best quarantine system, but really it‚Äôs a disaster in slow motion,‚Äù Mr Low said. ‚ÄúThe conservation movement should be talking more about quarantine, even if that means saying a bit less about habitat loss.‚Äù He pointed to the recent discoveries of myrtle rust (affecting trees) and white spot disease (at prawn farms) and said the Asian black-spined toad (a possible cold-climate cane toad) had been spotted in Australia. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a widespread misconception habitat loss is causing most extinctions in Australia, but evidence doesn‚Äôt back that up,‚Äù Mr Low said. He has recently produced a soon-to-be-released report for the Invasive Species Council showing that feral animals and introduced diseases pose a greater threat to Australia‚Äôs most vulnerable native wildlife than do most other factors. The 20-page document, entitled ‚ÄúInvasive Species: a leading threat to Australia‚Äôs wildlife‚Äù, obtained by The Weekend Australian, summarises the work of dozens of authors. It shows that introduced feral animals, weeds and diseases pose a severe risk to more than three-quarters of all amphibian, mammal and bird species on the threatened species list and to more than half of all types of threatened plants, fish and reptiles. Australia has lost more mammal species than any other country; feral cats and foxes are considered mostly to blame. The study points to only one extinct animal (the toolache wallaby) for which habitat loss is considered the primary driver of its demise. Invasive Species Council CEO Andrew Cox said the danger was ‚Äúnot just ongoing, it is increasing‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe size of the threat is far bigger than what most people had believed. It is largely invisible and slow moving. As a result, government responses have been poor and often misguided, long after it is too late,‚Äù he said.

ALL the floating ice could melt without having any effect on the sea level NASA‚Äôs Operation IceBridge has spotted a significant new rift in the ice shelf, near another longer, wider crack. The first photographs of a new and ominous crack in Greenland‚Äôs enormous Petermann glacier were captured by a NASA airborne mission Friday. NASA‚Äôs Operation IceBridge, which has been flying over northwest Greenland for the past several days, took the photos after being provided coordinates by Stef Lhermitte, a professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who had spotted it by examining satellite images. The NASA pictures make clear that a significant new rift has opened in the ice shelf ‚Äî one that is not so distant from another much wider and longer crack that has been slowly extending toward the shelf‚Äôs center from its eastern side wall. If the two cracks were to intersect, then a single break would run across more than half of the ice shelf. That might, in turn, cause the piece to begin to break away. But in the image NASA also noted another feature in the ice that it termed a ‚Äò‚Äòmedial flow line‚Äô‚Äô that, it said, ‚Äò‚Äòmay exert a stagnating effect on the propagation of the new rift toward the older one.‚Äô‚Äô So it remains to be seen just how much, and how rapidly, the new rift ‚Äî which has only just been discovered ‚Äî could undermine the floating ice shelf.

Government sources told The Daily Telegraph that the target, under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, is likely to be scrapped after Brexit. Brexit and EU regulation: A bonfire of the vanities? The UK is currently committed to getting 15 per cent of all energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2020. Ministers have long been critical of the targets because they exclude nuclear power, carbon capture or gains from energy efficiency. The UK is currently on course to miss the target and incur millions of pounds in fines from the European Union. Government sources told The Daily Telegraph that the target, under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, is likely to be scrapped after Brexit. The Daily Telegraph has called on the Conservative Party to promise a bonfire of EU red tape in its 2020 manifesto to put Britain on a radically different course. Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, has ‚Äúapplauded‚Äù the campaign and he backed calls to sweep away decades of ‚Äúburdensome‚Äù EU regulations after Brexit. It comes after civil service documents, photographed on a trade, revealed that Britain plans to scale down its concern over climate change after Brexit. Details of the policy change were contained in the papers of a senior civil servant at the Department for International Trade (DIT) photographed by a passenger earlier this month. The notes say: ‚ÄúTrade and growth are now priorities for all posts ‚Äî you will all need to prioritise developing capability in this area. Some economic security-related work like climate change and illegal wildlife trade will be scaled down.‚Äù Earlier this month Bloomberg, the news agency, revealed that officials at the Treasury and department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been discussing axing the renewables target.John The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires the UK to generate 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 ‚Äì up from three per cent when the directive was adopted in 2009. The target has led to billions of pounds Government subsidies for renewable power sources such as wind, solar and biomass power plants, which are ultimately paid for by customers through their energy bills. The National Audit Office estimated that green energy subsidies will cost every household ¬£110 a year by 2020. Owen Paterson, a Conservative MP and former Environment Secretary, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs distorting the whole energy market. It‚Äôs like the Sherrif of Nottingham ‚Äì it transfers money from my poorest constituents to my wealthiest constituents who are putting up pointless wind turbines heavily subsidised. I would be very happy to see the back of it.‚Äù SOURCE \\nReal science must guide policy Climate alarmists use faulty science and bald assertions to demand end to fossil fuels Paul Driessen All too many alarmist climate scientists have received millions in taxpayer grants over the years, relied on computer models that do not reflect real-world observations, attacked and refused to debate scientists who disagree with manmade climate cataclysm claims, refused to share their computer algorithms and raw data with reviewers outside their circle of fellow researchers ‚Äì and then used their work to make or justify demands that the world eliminate the fossil fuels that provide 80% of our energy and have lifted billions out of nasty, brutish, life-shortening poverty and disease. A recent US House of Representatives Science Committee hearing on assumptions, policy implications and scientific principles of climate change showcased this. Testimony by climate scientists Drs. John Christy, Judith Curry and Roger Pielke, Jr. contrasted sharply with that of Dr. Michael Mann. Christy noted that Congress and the public have been getting biased analyses and conclusions that begin with and attempt to confirm the belief that human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions drive climate change. He said government should ‚Äúorganize and fund credible ‚ÄòRed Teams‚Äô that look at issues such as natural variability, the failure of climate models and the huge benefits to society from affordable energy, carbon-based and otherwise.‚Äù He demonstrated how average global temperatures predicted by dozens of models for 2015 are now off by a full half-degree Celsius (0.9 F) from what has actually been measured. Curry discussed how she has been repeatedly vilified as an ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù climate change ‚Äúdenier‚Äù and ‚Äúdisinformer.‚Äù But she focused on the role of the scientific method, especially as related to the complex forces involved in climate change ‚Äì and especially when used to advise on policy and law. Real science means positing and proving a hypothesis with convincing real world evidence. Models can help, but only if they accurately reflect the total climate system and their results conform to real world observations. Pielke discussed his own mistreatment as a ‚Äúdenier‚Äù and showed that there is ‚Äúlittle scientific basis‚Äù for claims that extreme weather events (tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, droughts) have increased in recent decades due to GHG emissions. In fact, IPCC and other studies reveal that the USA and world have had ‚Äúremarkable good fortune‚Äù with extreme weather in recent years, compared to the past: 23 major hurricanes hit the US East Coast 1915-1964; but only 9 in 1965-2016 ‚Äì and not one since October 2005. He also offered 18 specific recommendations for improving scientific integrity in climate science. Mann said the other three witnesses represent a ‚Äútiny minority‚Äù who stand opposed to the 97% who agree that ‚Äúclimate change is real, is human-caused, and is already having adverse impacts on us, our economy, and our planet.‚Äù He defended his ‚Äúhockey stick‚Äù historic temperature graph, claimed climate models have been ‚Äútested vigorously and rigorously‚Äù and have ‚Äúpassed a number of impressive tests,‚Äù insisted that warming [of a couple hundredths of a degree] in recent years proves that manmade global warming ‚Äúhas continued unabated,‚Äù and accused those who contest these statements of being ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù deniers. The ‚Äú97% consensus‚Äù is imaginary ‚Äì a fabrication. One source was a survey sent to 10,256 scientists, of whom 3,146 responded. But their number was arbitrarily reduced to 77 ‚Äúexpert‚Äù or ‚Äúactive‚Äù climate researchers, of which 75 agreed with two simplistic questions that many would support. (Has Earth warmed since 1800? Did humans play a significant role?) Voila! 97% consensus. But what about the other 3,069 respondents? 75 out of 3,146 is barely 0.02 percent. Purported consensus studies by Cook, Oreskes and others were just as bogus. Moreover, governments have been spending billions of dollars annually on climate research. The vas majority went to the alarmist camp. If $25,000 or $100,000 a year from fossil fuel interests can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù skeptical scientists, as we are often told, how much ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù can billions purchase? If many scientists who contest ‚Äúdangerous manmade climate change‚Äù are harassed, or threatened with RICO prosecutions, how many will have the courage to speak out and challenge the ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù and ‚Äúsettled science‚Äù? These are timely questions. On April 12, 1633 the Catholic Church convicted astronomer Galileo Galilei of heresy, for refusing to accept its doctrine that the Sun revolves around the Earth. But far more important, the climate battle is not merely a debate over miasma versus germ theory of disease, AC versus DC current, or geologic mechanisms behind plate tectonics. It‚Äôs far more even than disagreements over how much humans might be affecting Earth‚Äôs climate, or how bad (or beneficial) future changes might be, on a planet where climate fluctuations have occurred throughout history. Manmade climate catastrophe claims are being used to justify demands that the United States and world eliminate the carbon-based fuels that provide 80% of the energy that makes modern industry, civilization and living standards possible ‚Äì and that continue to lift billions of people out of poverty and disease. Climate alarmists want that radical transformation to take place right now. McKinsey & Company, the UN and assorted activists say the world must spend some $93 trillion over the next 15 years to convert completely from fossil fuels to ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù energy! Or it will be too late. Our planet will be doomed. Claims and demands like those require solid, incontrovertible proof that climate alarmists are right. Not just computer models, repeated assertions, ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù among like-minded researchers seeking their next government grant, or a partial-degree of warming amid multiple El Ni√±os and cooling cycles. They require ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù analyses and open, unfettered debate over every aspect of human and natural influences on Earth‚Äôs climate, the ways carbon dioxide improves plant growth, and the need for abundant, reliable, affordable electricity and motor fuel for every person in every nation. We haven‚Äôt had any of that so far. Up to now, climate chaos is just one more Club of Rome supposedly looming disaster, supposedly caused by human intervention in natural processes, supposedly requiring immediate, fundamental changes in human behavior, to avoid supposed global calamities ‚Äì threats to the very survival of our wildlife, civilization and planet. It‚Äôs all assertions, devoid of persuasive evidence. It‚Äôs true that virtually all nations have signed the Paris accords. However, only President Obama signed it for the USA; the Senate never ratified the decision. And the US reduced its CO2 emissions by 12.5% since 2007, while Europe‚Äôs carbon dioxide emissions rose 0.7% in one year, 2014-2015. Britain is looking into rescinding some 2020 clean energy targets and using more coal and natural gas. EU nations are realizing that overpriced, unreliable wind and solar power is hammering families and killing their jobs and economies. Virtually all the developing nations that signed onto the Paris (non)treaty did so because they were promised trillions of dollars in climate ‚Äúadaptation, mitigation and reparation‚Äù money. That brings us to another April anniversary: the 1815 eruption of Indonesia‚Äôs Mt. Tambora. This monumental volcanic explosion blew an inconceivable 4,650 feet off the volcano; sent 36 cubic miles of ash, rock, sulfur and other gases into the atmosphere; triggered tsunamis that killed over 10,000 people; and caused serious climate changes and crop failures that killed 80,000 more over the following year. We may be about to witness another volcanic explosion. Under the Paris insanity, developed nations are expected to de-carbonize, de-industrialize and curb their growth ‚Äì while sending $100 billion per year to ruling elites in developing countries that are not required to trim fossil fuel use or GHG emissions. It cannot and will not happen. In fact, industrialized nations are already reneging on their pledges, refusing to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, or recasting current foreign aid as Paris climate money. China, India, Brazil and poor countries are outraged. They want new money, more money ‚Äì or else they will walk away from their commitments, and the Paris house of cards will collapse. It should collapse. Billions of people are still energy-deprived, impoverished, diseased and starving. Millions are dying needlessly every year. Faulty, authoritarian climate and ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù claims are being use to perpetuate these travesties. It‚Äôs time to help poor countries get the same energy, technologies and opportunities we have ‚Äì so that they can take their rightful places among Earth‚Äôs healthy and prosperous people.

Glenn Kessler awarded Pruitt four ‚ÄúPinocchios‚Äù in the fact check Friday ‚Äî the paper‚Äôs worst rating for truthfulness ‚Äî for a claim he made that China and India had ‚Äúno obligations‚Äù to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement. But Kessler seriously undercuts his conclusion by acknowledging in his review that the agreement in question is not legally binding, so China and India are not bound to follow its terms. The fact check centers on comments Pruitt made on ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù Thursday morning, when he said the Paris agreement the U.S. joined under former President Barack Obama did not put America first, because ‚ÄúChina and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030.‚Äù ‚ÄúPruitt appears to be stuck in a time warp,‚Äù Kessler wrote in the fact check. ‚ÄúHis concerns might have made more sense if he had been referring to the 1992 Kyoto Protocol, which did not require developing nations such as China and India to face legally binding requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.‚Äù ‚ÄúPruitt earns Four Pinocchios,‚Äù Kessler concluded, adding: ‚ÄúPruitt clearly needs to brush up on the Paris Accord, as it‚Äôs false to claim that China and India have ‚Äòno obligations‚Äô until 2030.‚Äù But early in the fact check, Kessler notes the Paris agreement itself is ‚Äúnot legally binding‚Äù because countries submit their own plans to cut emissions, which they can either follow through with or not. Whoops. No one is ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to do anything in terms of emissions under the Paris agreement under any time period, even in 2030. In fact, the Trump administration is in the process of undoing all the regulations Obama put in place to meet his Paris pledge of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2030. Pruit isn‚Äôt 100 percent right either, but he‚Äôs wrong for reasons WaPo didn‚Äôt bother covering. Pruitt qualified his comments by indicating those countries have no obligations until 2030, when the reality is those countries have no obligations, period, because the agreement is not binding. China has pledged to ‚Äúpeak‚Äù emissions by 2030, which means it can increase emissions in absolute terms during that time. India has made no promise to cut its total emissions levels. China‚Äôs emissions are expected to grow nearly 32 percent through 2040, according to projections from the Energy Information Administration, while India‚Äôs is expected to skyrocket nearly 110 percent. That growth would wipe out any emissions cuts from the U.S. and other developed countries, so any pledge by China and India to cut emissions intensity of their economy really amounts to a bait-and-switch. Kessler goes on to say Paris makes a distinction ‚Äúbetween developing and developed countries in that developed countries are expected to reduce actual emissions, while developing countries would lower emissions based on units tied to measures such as gross domestic product or economic output.‚Äù China promised to lower its emissions per unit of economic output, or GDP, 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. India pledged to cut emissions per unit of GDP 33 to 35 percent in that same time period. But those aren‚Äôt pledges China and India are legally obligated to work toward. Countries naturally reduce their emissions to GDP ratio as industries become more efficient over time and use less energy (mostly fossil fuels) to produce more goods. Look at global emissions intensity data compiled by the World Bank ‚Äî No Paris agreement necessary. China had already cut its emissions per unit of GDP nearly 34 percent below 2005 levels before Paris went into effect in 2016. India had decreased its emissions intensity 12.5 percent by 2010. And despite promises of using more green energy, both China and India will be using way more coal and fossil fuels in the future. EPA responded to Kessler after he published the fact check. ‚ÄúAdministrator Pruitt was referring to no emission reduction obligations,‚Äù an EPA spokeswoman said, adding ‚Äúno one has any obligations regarding emissions reductions activities under the Paris Agreement because it is ‚Äònon-binding.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are pretty clear that they aren‚Äôt really agreeing to do anything,‚Äù she said, referring to China. Kessler in turn responded to the EPA statement, saying that China and India are taking steps, even if they‚Äôre not bound by the agreement. ‚ÄúThis ignores that fact that China and India are actually taking steps to try to meet these commitments, with China on track to peak by 2025, if not sooner,‚Äù he said. Kessler ignores China and India aren‚Äôt actually ‚Äútaking steps.‚Äù Their economies are growing and their industries are becoming more efficient. It‚Äôs Econ 101. SOURCE \\nAustralia: A Dead Man Warns of a Dying Grid Not long before his sudden and premature death, Australian Energy Market Operator chief Matt Zema spoke candidly at a private conference of power-industry executives. The enormous subsidies heaped on renewables, he said, mean one thing and only one thing: ‚ÄúThe system must collapse‚Äù Matt Zema, inaugural head of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), attended a meeting a year ago of the Regulation Economics Energy Forum at which a number of prominent electricity industry executives were present. Proceedings at the meeting were private, but the need for confidentiality was removed with Matt‚Äôs sad death three months later. The following were among his remarks: ‚ÄúThe renewable developments and increased political interference are pushing the system towards a crisis. South Australia is most vulnerable with its potential for wind to supply 60% of demand and then to cut back rapidly. Each new windfarm constrains existing ones and brings demand for more transmission. The system is only manageable with robust interconnectors, but these operate effectively only because there is abundant coal-based generation in Victoria‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ wind, being subsidised and having low marginal costs, depresses the spot price and once a major coal plant has a severe problem it will be closed‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ wind does not provide the system security. But the politicians will not allow the appropriate price changes to permit profitable supply developments from other sources. And the original intent of having the generator or other beneficiary pay for transmission and services over and above energy itself has now been lost so there are no market signals, just a series of patch-ups that obscure the instability and shift the problem to include Victoria. In the end the system must collapse‚Ä¶‚Äù A month later South Australia‚Äôs coal-fuelled Northern Power Station was disconnected from the network because it was unable to operate profitably against subsidised intermittent renewable energy that has priority over other supplies. In September, 2016, as a result of this capacity reduction, South Australia lost all its power when storms triggered outages and several wind generators were unable to ‚Äúride through‚Äù, causing the main interconnector with Victoria to shut down. A more limited loss of power took place in February, 2017, when wind supply dropped from 800MW to under 100MW in four hours. The September, 2016, blackout is estimated to have cost the state $367 million. BHP, whose senior executives have long engaged in virtue-signalling in favour of carbon taxes and exotic ‚Äúclean‚Äù renewables, reported a loss of $US105 million with their Olympic Dam project ‚Äî a loss magnified by the company being forced to suspend its proposed doubling of the mine‚Äôs capacity as a result of power uncertainties. Engie, the owners of Hazelwood announced in November, 2016, that the 1600 megawatt facility (supplying between 20% and 25% of the state‚Äôs power) will be the fourth big coal-fired power station to close. Hazelwood had been allowed to deteriorate as a result of subsidised wind making the plant unprofitable, which did not stop Engie being ordered to complete major repairs to at least five of the eight boilers in order to meet occupational health and safety regulations. The bottom line is that the loss of the coal-powered stations has resulted in at least a doubling of the wholesale electricity price in the southern states and the concomitant loss of reliability. Blame shifting between politicians has characterised the various events. Reliable coal plants are being forced to close due to competition from renewables which currently enjoy a subsidy of $84 per MWH, double the actual price received by coal plants. The forced closure of these plants has compounded the cost impost by forcing up pool prices. The subsidies favouring renewable energy include several put in place by state governments, but the most important regulations are at the Commonwealth level ‚Äî especially those requiring increasing shares of wind and solar within the supply mix. These regulations give rise to the current subsidy for wind and solar, currently at $84 per MWh and capped at $92.5 per MWh. The roll-out of new subsidised power is on-going. And various schemes are being floated for buffering and overcoming wind‚Äôs intrinsic lack of reliability. Among these is the mooted South Australian battery investment using the technology developed by Elon Musk and the proposal floated by the Prime Minister to augment the Snowy hydro system with ‚Äúpumped storage‚Äù. These measures, should they go ahead, allow the transfer of power over time and, in doing so, reduce the gross power available. New ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù using subsidised wind and solar abound. Last week, for example, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill announced a new solar-battery combination, Lyon Solar in the Riverland, which promises 300 Megawatts of capacity. This is the equivalent of perhaps 80 megawatts of coal fuelled electricity and comes at a cost of one billion dollars. The now-shuttered Northern Power Station had 540 megawatts, yet Weatherill declined to take up an offer that would, for a mere $25 million, have kept it open. Instead, he plumped to spend $500 million-plus on a gas generator of half that capacity and, plus Elon Musk‚Äôs much bally-hooed batteries! On paper, the new Lyon Solar facility is profitable only because of the penalties imposed on coal. These include the subsidy under the Renewable Energy Target of $84 per MWh. In addition, the facility benefits from the forced closure of the coal-fired stations. This has resulted in the wholesale price of electricity rising to a new norm of $130 per MWh, compared with the average price in the four years to 2015 of $50 per MWh. The bottom line is that the consumer will pay $214 per MWh for $50-per-MWh worth of electricity from the new facility. With that sort of money being littered around the industry for gee-whizz exotic projects it is little wonder that moochers are circling the state like moths round a candle. In the end, renewables require at least three times the price of the supposed dinosaur facilities they are displacing; consumers and industry will need to pay this and, in addition, fork out for grid additions to offset some of the inevitable deterioration of reliability the brave new energy world entails. Obviously many outfits, especially those in the energy intensive mining and smelting and agricultural processing sectors will not find it profitable to remain in an Australian market where wholesale electricity prices have more than doubles and the system‚Äôs reliability has deteriorated. We are seeing the future with these renewable energy facilities and it is not working. The contagion that is undermining the South Australian economy and impoverishing the state‚Äôs households is spreading to Victoria. Ominously, on the very day that Hazelwood closed, Victoria evidenced what will be the new norm. Incredibly, with no heatwave or any other factor to inspire a spike in electricity demand, it had to import electricity from New South Wales and Tasmania.

See here or here 16 April, 2017 Arctic meltdown: Sea and land ice are cracking up at a record pace (!) I imagine that the figures below are all carefully cherrypicked in the usual Green/Left way but whether they are or not they are no disaster. As Archimdes discovered over 2,000 years ago, melting sea ice does NOT raise the water level. And the only substantial land mass in the Arctic is Greenland. And while there is some melting of Greenland coastal ice the interior icecap is and always has been stable. So it is only the coastal ice that could have some effect. But in a recent study it was projected to raise global sea levels by a whole 1.5 inches by 2100! So the shrieks of horror below are entirely without justification The images from the Arctic ice death spiral are haunting. The impacts will be terrifying. Driven by warming air and water temperatures, Arctic sea ice continues its death spiral. A big new crack has been found in a major outlet glacier of the Greenland ice sheet, whose disintegration is speeding up. Last month set records for the lowest Arctic sea ice extent ever in March, as well as the lowest sea ice volume and lowest sea ice thickness. The Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) at the University of Washington‚Äôs Polar Science Center provides monthly updates of Arctic sea ice volume. They using numerical modeling based on ‚Äúobservations from satellites, Navy submarines, moorings, and field measurements.‚Äù Ice volume is determined by figuring out sea ice extent or surface area\\u200a‚Äî\\u200aand then factoring in the ice thickness. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) tracks sea ice extent with satellites, and this year has seen record lows set every month. Indeed, as this figure shows, sea ice extent has been unusually flat over the last three months, which is normally a time of significant refreezing. But not only has sea ice extent been setting records for months, so has sea ice thickness. Arctic sea ice is in a state of meltdown, and at some point soon will simply become too thin and fragmented to be called an ‚Äúice cap.‚Äù Significantly, what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Arctic amplification drives more extreme weather in North America, while accelerating the defrosting of carbon-rich permafrost, which releases CO2 and methane that each cause faster warming\\u200a‚Äî\\u200aa dangerous amplifying feedback. Earth‚Äôs melting permafrost threatens to unleash a dangerous climate feedback loop In addition, as the sea ice disappears and Arctic warming speeds up, that causes faster melting of the land-based Greenland ice sheet, which in turn causes faster sea level rise. A recent study found that Greenland ice mass loss has tripled since 1997. So perhaps it‚Äôs not totally surprising that, as the Washington Post reported, ‚ÄúScientists just found a strange and worrying crack in one of Greenland‚Äôs biggest glaciers.‚Äù The implications of the ice cracking up at an accelerating rate are terrifying for humanity. The images created by it are haunting. SOURCE \\nEPA chief calls for exit from Paris climate agreement President Trump‚Äôs top environment official called Thursday for an exit from the historic Paris agreement, in what appeared to be the first time such a high-ranking official has so explicitly disavowed the agreement endorsed by nearly 200 countries to fight climate change. Speaking with \"Fox & Friends,\" Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt said, \"Paris is something that we need to really look at closely. It‚Äôs something we need to exit in my opinion.\" \"It‚Äôs a bad deal for America,\" Pruitt continued. \"It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030. We front-loaded all of our costs.\" Pruitt had called the Paris accord a \"bad deal\" in the past but does not appear to have previously gone so far as to call for the United States to withdraw. The Trump administration has previously said it is currently reviewing its position on climate change and energy policy and remains noncommittal, for now, on whether it will follow through on the president‚Äôs campaign pledge to \"cancel\" the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Trump‚Äôs recent executive order on energy policy, which set in motion the rollback of Obama‚Äôs domestic Clean Power Plan, was silent on the matter of Paris. \"You might have read in the media that there was much discussion about US energy policy and the fact that we‚Äôre undergoing a review of many of those policies,\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in Texas on Thursday, according to prepared remarks. \"It‚Äôs true, we are and it‚Äôs the right thing to do.\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the administration will resolve its view on the Paris accord \"by the time of the G7 Summit, late May-ish, if not sooner.\" Amid this uncertainty, the statement aligns Pruitt with a more hard-line approach held by some in the Trump administration, such as Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon, rather than the more moderate take of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson said in his confirmation hearing that the United States should have a \"seat at the table\" in the Paris negotiations, and Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump confidant Jared Kushner. Tillerson‚Äôs former company, ExxonMobil, has also supported the Paris accord, and in late March wrote a letter to the White House reiterating its view that \"the United States is well positioned to compete within the framework of the Paris agreement, with abundant low-carbon resources such as natural gas, and innovative private industries, including the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors.\" If the Trump administration wants to take a more moderate approach to the Paris deal, it could consider modifying the United States‚Äô current pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, rather than seeking to exit altogether. That‚Äôs a tack advanced in a letter to Trump, previously reported on by E&E News, by Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, who argued that the United States ‚Äúshould present a new pledge that does no harm to our economy,\" including highly efficient and low-emission coal-fired generators and nuclear power plants. It is far from clear how the Trump administration could actually \"exit\" the Paris agreement, if it determines that it wants to. Now that the agreement is in effect, it takes three years under its terms for a party to withdraw, followed by a one-year waiting period ‚Äî a length roughly equal to Trump‚Äôs first term in office. SOURCE \\nThe Magic Disappearing $100 Billion Climate Fund Walter Russell Mead Shocking news‚Äîthe magic $100 billion climate fund appears not to be taking shape! Even optimistic estimates sat the fund is $40 billion short, and developing countries say that understates the problem. The Financial Times: Climate ministers from Europe, India, Brazil and South Africa have gone to Beijing in recent weeks, hoping to sustain momentum from the Paris talks despite the Trump administration‚Äôs dismantling of US regulations meant to limit American emissions. But discussions have quickly run up against the issue of financing. ‚ÄúDeveloped countries have not met their commitments. In their reports a lot of their commitment is in the form of development aid. That doesn‚Äôt meet the commitment to contribute to new funds,‚Äù China‚Äôs top climate change negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, told a briefing on Tuesday. ‚ÄúA lot of countries don‚Äôt want to chip in. I said to the European minister: that‚Äôs your problem as developed countries. It‚Äôs your responsibility to work together and sort it out.‚Äù First world donors have been busily relabeling other foreign aid as contributions to the climate kitty. For developing countries, this is a cheat‚Äîthey expect $100 billion in new money. Or, to put it more accurately, they are not nearly stupid and naive enough to believe the lies Western diplomats tell when trying to bamboozle naive green voters at home that they are ‚ÄúDoing Something‚Äù about climate change. So they don‚Äôt really expect all that money, but hope to use these commitments to pry something out of the West. Also, since the West will certainly default on these bogus commitments, developing countries have all the justification they need to blow off their own commitments when the time comes. This, one notes, is the house of cards that the last Administration claimed was a big piece of its legacy. In any case, China, who the clueless Western press has tried to spin as the new hero and leader of the climate movement, is craftily working to widen the north south rift, piously calling on the selfish northern countries to make good on the $100 billion in new money. This failure will, of course, provide China with justification to walk away from any targets it wishes. After all, the West welshed first. Climate diplomacy has become the leading forum in our time for hypocritical posturing and the politics of pretense. Until the green movement wises up, develops a serious and pragmatic agenda, and pursues a strategically sound political approach, this sorry state of affairs is likely to continue. SOURCE \\nCoal\\'s Potential Comeback? There are still signs of life in the industry, but it\\'s going to take further deregulation and a favorable market. It‚Äôs the politically correct idea among many Americans that coal as a major industrial fuel is dead, or at least dying, and that ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù fuels like natural gas, wind and solar energy (and maybe unicorn dust) are taking over. There is some reality there, especially for natural gas due to the advancement of technology making it cheaper. But there are other influences on coal‚Äôs recent decline. Less costly natural gas has become the fuel of choice in power plants and for other industrial uses. That‚Äôs not entirely because of the natural relative price of the fuels, but because the regulatory overkill on mining and burning coal requires enormous investments that have priced coal higher than natural gas. Remember Barack Obama‚Äôs prediction: ‚ÄúSo if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can. It‚Äôs just that it will bankrupt them.‚Äù These regulations produced the closing of more than 400 coal-burning power plants, which dropped the demand for coal. That in turn put 63,000 people in the coal industry, electric production industry and related support industries out of work in just the last few years. At the same time hydraulic fracturing (fracking) became popular, after lying mostly dormant since its first commercial application in 1957. That produced a boom in natural gas production at attractive prices to compete with coal. Many think burning less coal is a great thing, because burning coal fouls the air and is dangerous to our health. But that ‚Äútruth‚Äù loses importance when you know the actual infinitesimal improvement in air quality derived from burning less coal. However, considering all those factors, and paraphrasing a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain, the rumors of coal‚Äôs demise have been greatly exaggerated. Coal likely will never regain its former dominance among industrial fuels. Time and technological/industrial evolution would just as certainly, although much more gradually, have eaten into coal‚Äôs popularity without the help of Obama‚Äôs War on Coal. But several things point to a continued market for American coal: Trump‚Äôs regulatory relief, the growing acceptance of the idea that the climate change/global warming mania is dramatically overstated, the reality that coal is still the best fuel for many things, the fact that many countries that do not have domestic coal supplies depend upon it for fuel, and the improvement in coal-burning technology. And let‚Äôs not forget that fossil fuels made up 81% of the fuels used to produce electricity in 2016, and coal is still the primary fossil fuel in electricity production. Industry insiders like Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray see a partial resurgence in coal. ‚ÄúCoal will grow back,‚Äù he told Fox Business Network‚Äôs Stuart Varney. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre in a decline right now.‚Äù He went on to say that Trump ‚Äúcan bring back at least half of those [63,000 lost] jobs as the economy grows and as he ends the regulations on coal.‚Äù He noted that we have not had a level playing field in coal because, instead, ‚Äúthe government has been picking winners and losers.‚Äù And he told Maria Bartiromo, also on Fox Business Network, that Obama closed 411 coal-fired plants, and that the Clean Power Plan, which Trump ended recently, would have closed 56 more plants. That, he said, would have caused a steep spike in electric rates. ‚ÄúAs [Trump] grows the economy [and] brings jobs back to America, coal will participate in that growth because we are one-sixth the cost of a windmill and one-fourth the cost of natural gas,‚Äù per kilowatt-hour, Murray said. Rep. Bill Johnson (R-OH), ‚ÄúThe coal industry knows and understands how to mine coal ‚Ä¶ and protect our environment. We don‚Äôt do it the way it was done 50, 60 years ago.‚Äù Here are a few pieces of evidence that coal isn‚Äôt dead yet: Reports from the Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia coalfield regions say that mines are cranking back up and miners are being rehired. Train yards are seeing cars filled with coal moving through them in greater numbers. Kingdom Resources plans to take over operations of one of the old Enterprise mines in Knott County, Kentucky. The company plans to hire 60 workers. A southern West Virginia college recently held a Job Fair to immediately fill 85 open coal positions in mines in two counties. The coal from these mines is used in making steel. Coal exports through Hampton Roads last month rose more than 50% from last year‚Äôs level, led by a nearly five-fold increase at Newport News\\' Pier IX, according to the most recent Virginia Maritime Association statistics. ‚ÄúA lot of mines are open again,‚Äù said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance.‚Äú Fox News reports that in Wise County, Virginia, \"A long-awaited revival is under way in this beleaguered Central Appalachia community where residents see coal as the once and future king. Trucks are running again. Miners working seven days a week cannot keep up with current demand.‚Äù Few if any argue that the coal industry will return to its former greatness, but it will certainly endure for many years at a lower level if natural forces are allowed to work, free of politically correct environmental engineering. These aforementioned items represent the beginning of coal‚Äôs potential comeback. When you replace regulations resulting from shortsighted ideological goals with a level of business regulations based upon common sense, good things can happen. SOURCE \\nAustralia: Another Greenie lie about coal Green groups opposed to the $16.5 billion Adani coalmine have been accused of propagating ‚Äúfake news‚Äù after circulating images of ‚Äúcoal dust‚Äù on beaches near the Abbot Point coal terminal that was revealed to be black mineral sand called magnetite. Queensland government environment officials yesterday confirmed they had ‚Äúno immediate concerns‚Äù about environmental damage near the north Queensland port, noting that beaches had ‚Äúregular depositions of minerals‚Äù. Aerial images depicting black streaks on Dingo Beach near the coal terminal were released by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Marine Conservation Society and splashed across the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday. The picture ran under the heading ‚Äúblack tide‚Äù and environmental groups used the photograph to rail against ‚ÄúAdani‚Äôs coal spill‚Äù. They said the beach appeared to be ‚Äúscattered with lumps of coal‚Äù that threatened a turtle nesting ground and the nearby habitat of the Australian Painted Snipe. Green groups also warned about a ‚Äúthick black sludge of coal‚Äù flowing from the Abbot Point terminal after satellite images, released by the Mackay Conservation Group, purported to show coal-laden water spilling into the neighbouring Caley Valley wetlands following tropical Cyclone Debbie. The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection said ‚Äúno conclusions can yet be made‚Äù, but initial monitoring results indicated releases into the wetlands were ‚Äúin accordance with temporary emissions licence conditions‚Äù. A coalition of politicians, resources groups and Queensland‚Äôs peak environment agency yesterday dismissed suggestions that coal had washed ashore. A spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society said it was unable to verify the presence of coal on the beach before releasing the images. Mike Brunker ‚Äî a former mayor and current Whitsunday councillor who is tipped to win ALP preselection for the new north Queensland state seat of McMaster ‚Äî said yesterday there was no coal in the wetlands. He said the black deposits on the beach were magnetite and naturally occurring. He added that locals distrusted the claims made by the ACF and AMCS. ‚ÄúI understand they are on the opposing side,‚Äù Mr Brunker said. ‚ÄúThey want to save the planet but it‚Äôs the extremes they go to prove a point. They are losing credibility. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs naturally there. You can see the formation of the sand. It‚Äôs a naturally occurring thing. If you get a magnet on it, the magnet picks it up.‚Äù The Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection debunked the environmental groups‚Äô claims, saying it had ‚Äúno immediate concern regarding images in the media showing black deposits on beaches adjacent to the Abbott Point coal terminal‚Äù. ‚ÄúRegional shorelines are known for regular depositions of minerals in sand,‚Äù a department spokesman said. ‚ÄúThe department is undertaking sampling to confirm that it is mineral sand.‚Äù Resources Minister Matt Canavan attacked the integrity of the groups campaigning against the Adani mine. ‚ÄúUnless Cyclone Debbie was so powerful it changed the chemical composition of coal, there‚Äôs no evidence at all that coal has washed up on the beach,‚Äù Senator Canavan said. ‚ÄúThese green groups have absolutely no credibility now. And nothing they say can be trusted.‚Äù AMCS Great Barrier Reef campaign director Imogen Zethoven yesterday defended the decision to release the images, saying no one had yet tested the sand for traces of coal. ‚ÄúThe purpose of us releasing those photos ... was to draw public attention to the issue and to call for an urgent transparent and independent investigation,‚Äù she said. Ms Zethoven said the head of corporate affairs at Adani had offered the conservation group an opportunity to visit Dingo Beach, but withdrew the offer after AMCS asked to bring an ecologist, soil scientist and a photographer. Adani spokesman Ron Watson said the sand along the beaches in the area varied between white and black. He also said preliminary testing of the Caley Valley Wetlands by the environment department, following the release of the satellite imagery, had found ‚Äúthe water quality was within the required limits‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a basalt magnetite mix,‚Äù he said, describing the black sand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very heavy and magnetic in parts which is what Captain Cook discovered in 1770 when he sailed by the nearby Magnetic Island. We offered to take one of the environmentalists. But they refused on the basis that we wouldn‚Äôt allow them to take water samples.‚Äù An Adani spokesman said last night police were called after an unknown vessel arrived at Dingo Beach yesterday, allegedly breaching security conditions. Whitsunday Regional Council mayor Andrew Willcox took a magnet with him to inspect the beach on Thursday ‚Äúto prove a point‚Äù after he heard about the aerial photographs. ‚ÄúWhat they need to do is just stick to the actual facts ... I took a magnet with me because coal is not attracted to a magnet but magnetite is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just ran it over different sections of the beach and that black stuff there is definitely magnetite.‚Äù Queensland Resources Council chief executive Ian Macfarlane rubbished the claims. Andrew Morrell, who is a Juru traditional owner and part of a native title claim covering one third of the wetlands, said he thought there ‚Äúcould be some coal among the magnetite‚Äù and pushed for an investigation because traditional owners were concerned.

See here or here 14 April, 2017 A new shriek from an old shrieker Prof. Lowe has long been a critic of Australia and a proclaimer of climate doom but has shown no prophetic skill. An amusing thing about him is that he was taken in by the Chief Seattle hoax, a speech really written by Ted Perry for a film script. That shows you how careful he is with checking the facts. He is a pseudo-scientist. His statement that opening one more coal mine will ‚Äúeffectively guarantee the frying of the planet‚Äù shows you how loony he is UNLESS the Australian government fully embraces renewable energy and moves to decarbonise our energy supply in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, parts of Australia like Bourke and Alice Springs will become unlivable in our lifetime. That‚Äôs the warning from the highly decorated Professor Emeritus of the School of Science at Griffith University, and former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Professor Ian Lowe. As public debate rages over the potential opening of the Adani coal mine in Carmichael, Queensland, Prof Lowe believes the government‚Äôs dedication to fossil fuels is taking the country in a troubling direction. Speaking to news.com.au he worried that the government‚Äôs intention to not only open up the controversial Carmichael coal mine but also open up the Galilee basin will ‚Äúeffectively guarantee the frying of the planet‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf we continue to expand fossil fuels ‚Äî which is what things like opening up the Galilee Basin means ‚Äî by 2050 the average global temperature will be at least two degrees more,‚Äù he said. Under such a scenario, he expects parts of inland Australia to see average temperature rises that would make them virtually unlivable by the second half of the century. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to imagine how life will continue in places like Alice Springs and Bourke under that sort of regime.‚Äù In the coming decades, he believes countries including Australia who are not doing enough to combat global warming will receive backlash from the international community. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôll be increasing international pressure for Australia to get into line,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think there will be political and trade sanctions on countries that are not seen to be pulling their weight.‚Äù Malcolm Turnbull‚Äôs Coalition government is backing the Adani coal mine, claiming it will provide 10,000 jobs for the state of Queensland. However other reports put that number as low as 1,464. Union leaders and regional mayors in Queensland as well as the Labor state government have also thrown their support behind the project, despite federal opposition leader Bill Shorten‚Äôs opposition to it. SOURCE \\nClimate alarmist agency says common myth about global warming is not true During an October 2016 campaign stop, Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore repeated a common claim made by climate alarmists about the alleged link between increased global temperatures and hurricanes‚Äîone that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is now saying has yet to be proven. ‚ÄúHurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change,‚Äù Clinton said, according to a report by the Washington Post. ‚ÄúRight now, the ocean is at or near record high temperatures, and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot, one foot, in much of the southeast, which means that Matthew‚Äôs storm surge was higher, and the flooding was more severe.‚Äù Gore expanded on Clinton‚Äôs argument. ‚ÄúIt spun up from a tropical storm into a category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours,‚Äù Gore said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs extremely unusual.‚Äù Although these and similar claims suggesting hurricanes have worsened or increased in frequency as a result of global warming have been used often and with certainty by climate alarmists, the NOAA is now saying there is no definitive evidence that proves the alleged link. The NOAA is a federal government agency in the Department of Commerce that argued in favor of the theory man is primarily responsible for rising global temperatures under President Barack Obama. According to a new report by the NOAA‚Äôs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory reviewing existing evidence, ‚ÄúIt is premature to conclude that human activities‚Äìand particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming‚Äìhave already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity.‚Äù NOAA said despite the fact that there currently is no evidence to support the claim, it believes there will be at some point in the future (sort of). According to the alarmist NOAA, ‚ÄúAnthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause tropical cyclones globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.‚Äù They also said the odds are ‚Äúbetter than even‚Äù (how scientific of them!) ‚Äúanthropogenic warming over the next century will lead to an increase in the occurrence of very intense tropical cyclone in some basins‚Äìan increase that would be substantially larger in percentage terms than the 2-11% increase in the average storm intensity.‚Äù However, NOAA‚Äôs report also says, ‚ÄúThis increase in intense storm occurrence is projected despite a likely decrease (or little change) in the global numbers of all tropical cyclones.‚Äù Put simply, NOAA says there is no evidence hurricanes are more intense or have increased in frequency because of global warming, but it believes hurricanes could become more intense (by 2-11 percent) by 2100, even though there will likely be less total tropical cyclones. SOURCE \\nNew global warming study is terrible news for alarmists, good news for plants, animals and people A new study published in the highly influential journal Nature suggests rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries may be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced, estimated based on its models ‚Äúthe sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200-year record captured,‚Äù according to an article published on the UC Merced website. Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which power plants, using sunlight. According to the UC Merced article, ‚ÄúThe research did not identify the cause of the increased photosynthesis, but computer models have shown several processes that could, together, create such a large change in global plant growth.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe leading candidates are rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture,‚Äù the article also claims. In other words, more carbon dioxide, which is being produced by humans at record levels, has improved plant growth, which in turn improves food production for humans and animals. ‚ÄúThe rising CO2 level stimulates crops yields,‚Äù said lead researcher Elliott Campbell, a professor at UC Merced. Campbell said the evidence shows ‚Äúa fundamental shift in the Earth‚Äôs plants‚Äù and that ‚Äúglobal plant growth should be a central goal for the human race.‚Äù However, don‚Äôt too excited, Campbell warns. He says despite the researchers‚Äô findings, which clearly show global warming helps plants‚Äîand thus also helping humans and animals‚Äîglobal warming has many negative effects, too, such as causing ‚Äúclimate change, which will increase flooding of coastal cities, extreme weather and ocean acidification.‚Äù The researchers‚Äô study in Nature provided no proof of the claim global warming is caused by humans or that global warming will cause the severe problems Campbell said it will in the quotes provided by the UC Merced article. The study also offered no solutions for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions without causing severe economic and social problems for billions of people. The study did, however, show increased carbon-dioxide levels have, generally, helped plants and crops. SOURCE \\nLiberals bamboozle public into believing global warming The public is being bamboozled into thinking that some liberal eggheads, like Al Gore, are the smartest people in the world, and we willingly give them ever more control over our lives. It seems we have forgotten how to use our own God-given commonsense. We‚Äôre like Chicken Little and her barnyard friends, so sure that the sky is falling that we end up being eaten by the fox, aka the federal government. A 2012 op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal and signed by 16 scientists debunked the connection between global warming and carbon dioxide. The article states that CO2 is not a pollutant, but a ‚Äúkey component of the biosphere‚Äôs life cycle.‚Äù The column also notes that the alarmism over climate is of great benefit to many ‚Äúproviding government funding for academic research and a reason for government bureaucracies to grow.‚Äù It‚Äôs the old ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù theme. To quote Lord Christopher Monckton of the Science and Public Policy Institute when referring to the United Nation‚Äôs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ‚ÄúIn the 19th century, British prime ministers used to say there were ‚Äòlies, damned lies, and statistics.‚Äô In the 21st century, we may say there are frauds, serious frauds, and IPCC Assessment Reports.‚Äù The Earth is an amazing organism. It is not as fragile as the radical environmentalists claim. It has amazing powers to clean and heal itself. I do not mean to imply that we should squander natural resources or fail to protect our water or air. We all want clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, but this has nothing to do with man-made global warming or climate change. When I was growing up, it was simply called conservation. It has now morphed into radical environmentalism. It just seems to me to be the height of narcissism to believe that we, as mere human beings, in the short time we have been on this Earth, could have the power to melt polar ice caps, cause the oceans to rise or fall, and cause extreme weather. I remember the warnings of ‚Äúthe coming ice age‚Äù back in the 1970s. That has not yet happened and, if it does, it will not have anything to do with humans. It has been estimated that the Earth has been around for about 4.6 billion years, the modern form of human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, civilization is about 6,000 years old, and industrialization started only about 200 years ago. In that time, the Earth has gone through warming, cooling, rising oceans, earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions and other forms of climate disruptions. Species have come and gone. It is estimated that over 90 percent of species that once walked the earth are now extinct. And more are becoming extinct every day. By the same token new ones are being discovered all the time. And human beings, as much as we may like to believe we are that powerful, have nothing to do with any of it. You can call me a ‚Äúdenier,‚Äù if you wish. But I prefer to think of myself as an ‚Äúaffirmer.‚Äù I affirm our God-given gifts of natural resources, such as oil, gas, and coal, contained in the Earth, were put there for our use ‚Äî responsibly of course. But just leaving them where they are is to squander that gift. SOURCE \\nShedding new light on global warming We are still warming slightly from a minor Ice Age called the ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age‚Äù. This was the coldest sustained period over the past 10,000 years and glaciers and sea ice advanced to record levels up to about 1700. There has been some warming since that time and there is nothing unusual or unprecedented about the Earth‚Äôs recovery since then. The warming since 1850 is about 0.8C, according to HAD 4 surface data, and that‚Äôs about 0.5C per century. The latest data shows less sensitivity to CO2 and this shows up in PR studies. For example, there are a number of recent sea level rise and glacier studies that show a deceleration or little change since 1950. And all models for Antarctica and Greenland show little sea level rise problems for the next 300 years. But fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) have certainly changed our health and well-being over 200 years. From the time of the first humans until 1810 the average life expectancy was less than 40 years. As the industrial revolution progressed this life expectancy also rapidly increased and today the first world has an average life expectancy of about 80 years and developing countries are catching up fast. And a baby born today in Australia has an average life expectancy of 90 years. CO2 has also caused greening of the Earth over the past 35 years and this shows up in satellite data. It is the best plant fertiliser and also helps with drought tolerance as well. I‚Äôm not interested in silly religious dogma and I only refer to evidence, data and the scientific method, but please look up Dr Hans Rosling‚Äôs efforts to try to educate people right around the world. See YouTube for Rosling‚Äôs ‚Äú200 countries since 1810‚Äù and his TED talk trying to dispel our ignorance.

See here or here 13 April, 2017 Study offers a dire warning on climate change (!) They\\'re getting cautious: New prophecy tells of the 23rd century, so is unfalsifiable to us. There is much to amuse in it in addition to the postponed disaster date. For many years, Warmists claimed that it would be the clap of doom when we reached 400ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere We have now arrived there and nothing has happened. Thor/Zeus/Jehovah seems to have put away his thunderbolts. So now 900ppm is the new arbitrarily chosen level of doom. And the whole article depends for its estimates of the levels of CO2 and the effect of CO2 on what other Warmists have written. The authors get their estimate of climate sensitivity by using that given in previous studies. So there is no new data in the paper at all. It is just an exercise in climate theology But they makes some pesky admissions along the way. They say that the historical trend is for CO2 levels to FALL. See their graph below. So if CO2 is a danger, we have got history on our side I add the journal abstract to the summary article below Continuing to burn fossil fuels at the current rate could bring atmospheric carbon dioxide to its highest concentration in 50 million years, jumping from about 400 parts per million now to more than 900 parts per million by the end of this century, a study warns. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated beyond that point, the climate could reach a warming state that hasn‚Äôt been seen in the past 420 million years. Some research suggests that, if humans burned through all fossil fuels on Earth, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could hit 5,000 parts per million by the year 2400. The new study speaks to the power of human influence over the climate. It suggests that after millions of years of relative stability in the absence of human activity, just a few hundred years of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are on track to cause unprecedented warming. To come to these grim conclusions, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers constructed a continuous record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations spanning the last 420 million years. They created the record by compiling more than 1,500 estimates of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations drawn from 112 published studies. According to lead author Gavin Foster, a geochemistry professor at the University of Southampton, those estimates were constructed mainly using the carbon isotope composition of ancient soil samples or examining the abundance of pores on the leaves of fossilized plants, an indicator of how much carbon dioxide was available for them to draw from the air while they were alive. The findings suggest that, until humans started rapidly burning fossil fuels with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Earth‚Äôs climate had been relatively stable for millions of years, and carbon dioxide concentrations were declining. Thanks to the human emission of greenhouse gases, though, that‚Äôs all changing at a record-breaking pace. Current concentrations of CO2 emissions are at their highest in human history, hovering around 400 parts per million and continuing to rise. Before the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide concentrations had settled into an average of about 280 parts per million. On a business-as-usual pathway ‚Äî in which greenhouse gas emissions would continue at their current rate ‚Äî carbon dioxide concentrations would hit a level that hasn‚Äôt been seen in 50 million years, according to the research. The warming that will be brought on by the continued emission of greenhouse gases will only be compounded by an increase in solar radiation as the sun continues to grow brighter, the researchers said. A business-as-usual trajectory suggests that carbon dioxide levels could exceed 2,000 parts per million by the year 2250, concentrations that were last seen about 200 million years ago. But thanks to the combined influence of a hotter future sun, the planet‚Äôs resulting warming will probably be greater than at almost any point in the past 420 million years. Additionally, at least one study has suggested that concentrations could be as high as 5,000 parts per million by 2400 if humans were to burn through all the fossil fuels on Earth, and that would result in both the highest carbon dioxide levels and the highest temperatures seen in the study period. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has presented estimates of how much the Earth might warm under a business-as-usual trajectory over certain time periods. It suggests that by 2300, the Earth could warm by nearly 48 degrees Fahrenheit. But there are many factors that could affect temperature trends in the long-term that remain uncertain, Foster suggested, such as changes in terrestrial vegetation or the amount of carbon dioxide the ocean has room to absorb in the coming centuries. As a result, he said, long-term warming could end up being even more intense than we estimate now. The study helps address a kind of paradox in the Earth‚Äôs climate history. Based on our knowledge of the way stars generate energy, scientists know that our solar system‚Äôs young sun would have been much dimmer millions of years ago. Over time, its intensity has increased, and is likely to continue doing so for millions or even billions of years. If the sun has been getting hotter for millions of years, though, then one would expect the planet‚Äôs climate to have steadily warmed during that time, as well, Foster noted. But there is ample evidence from the fossil record to suggest the planet‚Äôs climate actually remained mostly stable for millions of years before humans began burning fossil fuels. Scientists have hypothesized that this stability came from a long-term reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which offset the warming caused by a brightening sun. The new study supports this idea. The researchers‚Äô record suggests that, while there have been fluctuations throughout history, the long-term average carbon dioxide concentration generally declined until the Industrial Revolution as a result of natural processes related to the formation of Earth. Thanks to human activity, carbon dioxide levels are rising again, on track to break millennial-scale records if mitigation efforts aren‚Äôt undertaken, the study says. Foster emphasizes the new historical record is not perfect. But as far as we know, future warming ‚Äúis going to be unprecedented.\" SOURCE Future climate forcing potentially without precedent in the last 420 million years Gavin L. Foster et al. Abstract The evolution of Earth‚Äôs climate on geological timescales is largely driven by variations in the magnitude of total solar irradiance (TSI) and changes in the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere. Here we show that the slow ?50?Wm?2 increase in TSI over the last ?420 million years (an increase of ?9?Wm?2 of radiative forcing) was almost completely negated by a long-term decline in atmospheric CO2. This was likely due to the silicate weathering-negative feedback and the expansion of land plants that together ensured Earth‚Äôs long-term habitability. Humanity‚Äôs fossil-fuel use, if unabated, risks taking us, by the middle of the twenty-first century, to values of CO2 not seen since the early Eocene (50 million years ago). If CO2 continues to rise further into the twenty-third century , then the associated large increase in radiative forcing, and how the Earth system would respond, would likely be without geological precedent in the last half a billion years. Nature Communications 8, Article number: 14845 (2017)doi:10.1038/ncomms14845 \\nParis Climate Treaty Garners Unlikely Supporters The White House announced on March 30th that it would decide whether and how the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Treaty before the G-7 begins to meet on May 26th. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, published an op-ed in the Washington Times on March 29th urging the President to withdraw from Paris. My CEI colleague Chris Horner also published an op-ed on getting out of Paris earlier in March. On the other hand, considerable support for staying in Paris has emerged in recent days from unlikely places. Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, has circulated a draft letter to President Trump for signature by his House colleagues that begins, ‚ÄúAs you contemplate your actions related to the Paris Agreement, we would like to share with you the following conditions we believe should be met if the United States of America is to remain a party to the Agreement.‚Äù The conditions set down in Cramer‚Äôs letter include: replacing the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% below the 2005 baseline by 2025 with a more modest target; ending funding of the Green Climate Fund while remaining a member of it in order to veto projects we don‚Äôt like; and using our ‚Äúseat at the Paris table‚Äù to promote technologies such as carbon capture and storage that will ensure a future for coal. Rep. Cramer has not yet released his final letter, so we don‚Äôt know how many House Members have signed it. Another letter to President Trump was released this week. The president and CEO of Cloud Peak Energy (a Rocky Mountain coal company), Colin Marshall, urges the President to stay in the Paris Climate Treaty in order to ‚Äúuse U.S. influence to ensure that fossil energy remains a driver of global prosperity while addressing climate concerns.‚Äù Although Marshall quotes economist Richard Tol on the fact that climate policies have been more about rewarding allies with subsidies than with reducing emissions, his letter then goes on to request subsidies for the coal industry, including funding for carbon capture and storage technology. My comments on the Cloud Peak letter can be found in Michael Bastasch‚Äôs article for the Daily Caller News Foundation. To summarize, I think the reasons given in the letter for staying in Paris are unbelievably stupid. It has been reported that Peabody Energy and Arch Coal have also told the White House that they do not object to staying in Paris if the administration can secure more funding for carbon capture and storage. SOURCE \\nUnknown Climate Cause and Effect Climate curmudgeons claim there exists a near-perfect CO2-temperature relationship. They lecture that ‚Äúthe science is settled.‚Äù But it‚Äôs impossible to honestly say that the science is settled when absolute proof regarding carbon dioxide‚Äôs effects on temperature doesn‚Äôt exist. In a new paper published at the Hoover Institution, ‚ÄúFlawed Climate Models,‚Äù David R. Henderson and Charles L. Hooper explain in detail the widening divide regarding scientific proof. As Henderson and Hooper point out, ‚Äú[A] hypothesis is just that. We have virtually no ability to run controlled experiments, such as raising and lowering CO2 levels in the atmosphere and measuring the resulting change in temperatures.‚Äù In the field of science, that‚Äôs a critical problem. And what scientists are left with instead are extrapolations that are interpreted through the lens of computer models. ‚ÄúThe problem,‚Äù the authors contend, ‚Äúis that these models have serious limitations that drastically limit their value in making predictions and in guiding policy.‚Äù They narrow these flaws down to three primary obstacles: measurement error, solar energy and cloud imprecisions. Concerning the first issue, they quote Stanford scientist Patrick Frank, who in 2011, according to Henderson and Hooper, revealed that ‚Äútemperatures recorded by weather stations have been incorrectly handled. Temperature readings, he finds, have errors over twice as large as generally recognized. ‚Ä¶ The error bars are wider than the measured increase. It looks as if there‚Äôs an upward temperature trend, but we can‚Äôt tell definitively.‚Äù On solar energy, they continue, ‚ÄúThe sun‚Äôs energy that reaches the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere provides 342 Wm‚Äì2 ‚Äî an average of day and night, poles and equator ‚Äî keeping it warm enough for us to thrive. The estimated extra energy from excess CO2 ‚Äî the annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution ‚Äî is far smaller, according to Frank, at 0.036 Wm‚Äì2, or 0.01 percent of the sun‚Äôs energy. If our estimate of the sun‚Äôs energy were off by more than 0.01 percent, that error would swamp the estimated extra energy from excess CO2.‚Äù Then there are clouds. Write Henderson and Hooper: ‚ÄúWhy are clouds hard to model? They are amorphous; they reside at different altitudes and are layered on top of each other, making them hard to discern; they aren‚Äôt solid; they come in many different types; and scientists don‚Äôt fully understand how they form. As a result, clouds are modeled poorly. ‚Ä¶ If our climate model‚Äôs calculation of clouds were off by just 0.9 percent ‚Ä¶ that error would swamp the estimated extra energy from excess CO2. The total combined errors in our climate model are estimated be about 150 Wm‚Äì2, which is over 4,000 times as large as the estimated annual extra energy from higher CO2 concentrations.‚Äù The full article goes into even more detail on the unknown climate cause and effect and is well worth your time. But the bottom line is that global warming, though real, has not matched the modeled projections. Not even close. And the consequences of blindly making policy decisions does a great disservice to society. SOURCE \\nSmall-Engines vs. Ethanol Regs As spring begins to spur lawns and trees into full grow mode, many folks find themselves heading into the garage or shed to crank up the old mower and weed whacker that have been sitting dormant since last fall. After the seemingly hundredth pull on the starter cord with not even the slightest sputter of engine life, a frustrated individual may wonder if the culprit is ethanol. Ethanol has been around for quite some time. But especially since the passage of the Renewable Fuel Standards in 2007, the debate over the benefits or drawbacks of ethanol-infused gasoline continues, and nowhere does it rage more than within the world of small-engine equipment. Kris Kiser, the president and CEO of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, is no fan of the supposed enviro-friendly regulation. Kiser says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre putting alcohol into the fuel. They‚Äôre different atoms. They don‚Äôt like to stay married.‚Äù He continues, ‚ÄúThis is a big deal, and everybody wants to downplay it. But we‚Äôre pretty sensitive to it.‚Äù And while proponents of the ethanol blends point to the fact that manufactures are developing engines better suited to handle the higher percentages of ethanol, the truth remains that ethanol negatively impacts gasoline engines. Anyone who has recently bought a small engine can attest to the fact that most warranties are voided if a higher-than-10% ethanol blend of gasoline is used. The ethanol fuel standards are a classic example of government-forced industry adjustment aimed at artificially propping up an industry that would otherwise cease to exist if not for the mandate. Not only are ethanol blends consistently less fuel efficient, they also heavily impact other aspects of the economy, such as food prices. When the government attempts to pick winners and losers, the result is more losers. Let‚Äôs revoke the ethanol regulations and allow the free market to determine if the industry thrives or dies.

And Qld. has a Green/Left government IN THE latest instalment of sometimes-offbeat Queensland politics, the state‚Äôs upcoming May budget is being held hostage by two men from the outback. And they are refusing to release it until the Premier agrees to start killing crocodiles. The Sunshine State‚Äôs two cross bench Katter‚Äôs Australia Party MPs, Robbie Katter and Shane Knuth, helped Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk form a minority government in the state‚Äôs hung parliament in 2015. The pair has largely supported the Labor Party in the ensuing two years, but over the issue of crocodile culling, they have put their collective feet down. Mount Isa MP Mr Katter and Dalrymple‚Äôs Mr Knuth say they will not let Ms Palaszczuk‚Äôs May budget pass, unless she agrees to crocodile population control measures in the state‚Äôs north. Among the measure the pair want the Premier to agree to are crocodile hunting safaris, similar to African big game hunts that attract tourists from across the globe. ‚ÄúPeople think it‚Äôs unreasonable making threats on the budget, well how else do you get people to listen?‚Äù Mr Katter told reporters in Cairns. ‚ÄúOur obligation is to go down there and vote for the interests of north Queensland, and if people are dying and you can‚Äôt get them to listen, what are you supposed to do?‚Äù Queensland‚Äôs Labor government relies on the crossbench in the hung parliament, in particular the KAP, for support to pass supply bills. The unusual ransom follows a number of crocodile attacks in north Queensland recently. Cairns spearfisherman Warren Hughes, 35, was killed by a crocodile in shallow tropical waters near Innisfail last month, just hours before a teenager was mauled in the same area. Wildlife authorities killed a four-metre crocodile believed responsible for Mr Hughes‚Äô death. Mr Knuth also released an image last week of the remains of a pet dog being consumed by one of the massive reptiles on a farm near Innisfail. The KAP‚Äôs proposal includes managed culls, egg collection and movement strategies. In particular, they are calling for local indigenous groups to run safaris for tourists, as a way of generating income while keeping crocodile populations in check. They said they had the support of fellow northern Queensland crossbencher, Cook MP Billy Gordon. ‚ÄúAttacks are on the rise, the crocs we‚Äôre seeing are big, aggressive and territorial, and crocs are surfacing in places they‚Äôve never been before,‚Äù Mr Katter told the Cairns Post. ‚ÄúPeople are petrified to get out and enjoy the waterways, even in safe areas, with membership dropping in water sport clubs and iconic events cancelled due to croc sightings.‚Äù The issue of crocodile culling arises frequently in Queensland, however, Ms Palaszczuk has previously ruled adoption of the measure out.

See here or here 12 April, 2017 Falling Sea Level was the Critical Factor in 2015/2016 Great Barrier Reef Coral Bleaching! That sea levels could fall is of course be unthinkable to a Warmist. In their religion sea levels only rise. In fact sea levels both rise and fall all over the place worldwide. There has even been a fall in recent decades in Moreton Bay , near where I live. And are we allowed to mention the remarkable sea-level testimony of Tasmania\\'s Isle of the Dead? Read the late John Daly on the matter. He knew where all the skeletons are buried. There\\'s a whole graveyard of them. It is only highly theoretical isostatic \"rebound\" adjustments to the raw tide gauge data that enable Warmists to produce any picture of global sea level rise. Sad below that it took Indonesian scientists to face what was actually going on It is puzzling why the recent 2017 publication in Nature, Global Warming And Recurrent Mass Bleaching Of Corals by Hughes et al. ignored the most critical factor affecting the 2016 severe bleaching along the northern Great Barrier Reef ‚Äì the regional fall in sea level amplified by El Ni√±o. Instead Hughes 2017 suggested the extensive bleaching was due to increased water temperatures induced by CO2 warming. In contrast in Coral Mortality Induced by the 2015‚Äì2016 El-Nino in Indonesia: The Effect Of Rapid Sea Level Fall by Ampou 2017, Indonesian biologists had reported that a drop in sea level had bleached the upper 15 cm of the reefs before temperatures had reached NOAA‚Äôs Coral Reef Watch bleaching thresholds. As discussed by Ampou 2017, the drop in sea level had likely been experienced throughout much of the Coral Triangle including the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and then accelerated during the El Ni√±o. They speculated sea level fall also contributed to the bleaching during the 1998 El Ni√±o. Consistent with the effects of sea level fall, other researchers reported bleaching in the GBR was greatest near the surface then declined rapidly with depth. Indeed if falling sea level was the main driver in 2016‚Äôs reef mortalities, and this can be tested, then most catastrophic assertions made by Hughes 2017 would be invalid. Indeed the Great Barrier Reef had also experienced falling sea levels similar to those experienced by Indonesian reefs. Visitors to Lizard Island had reported more extreme low tides and more exposed reefs as revealed in the photograph above, which is consistent with the extremely high mortality in the Lizard Island region during the 2016 El Ni√±o. Of course reefs are often exposed to the air at low tide, but manage to survive if the exposure is short or during the night. However as seen in tide gauge data from Cairns just south of Lizard Island, since 2010 the average low tide had dropped by ~10 to 15 cm. After previous decades of increasing sea level had permitted vertical coral growth and colonization of newly submerged coastline, that new growth was now being left high and dry during low tide. As a result shallow coral were increasingly vulnerable to deadly desiccation during more extreme sea level drops when warm waters slosh toward the Americas during an El Ni√±o. Furthermore, an El Ni√±o in the Coral Triangle not only causes a sudden sea level fall, but it also generates a drier high-pressure system with clear skies, so that this region is exposed to more intense solar irradiance. In addition, El Ni√±o conditions reduce regional winds that drive reef-flushing currents and produce greater wave washing that could minimize desiccation during extreme low tides. And as one would predict, these conditions were exactly what were observed during El Ni√±o 2016 around Lizard Island and throughout the northern GBR. Aerial surveys, on which Hughes 2017 based their analyses, cannot discriminate between the various causes of bleaching. To determine the cause of coral mortality, careful examination of bleached coral by divers is required to distinguish whether bleached coral were the result of storms, crown-of-thorns attacks, disease, aerial exposure during low tides, or anomalously warmer ocean waters. Crown-of-thorns leave diagnostic gnawing marks, while storms produce anomalous rubble. Furthermore aerial surveys only measure the areal extent of bleaching, but cannot determine the depth to which most bleaching was restricted due to sea level fall. To distinguish bleaching and mortality caused by low tide exposure, divers must measure the extent of tissue mortality and compare it with changes in sea level. For example, the Indonesian researchers found the extent of dead coral tissue was mostly relegated to the upper 15 cm of coral, which correlated with the degree of increased aerial exposure by recent low tides. Unfortunately Hughes et al never carried out, or never reported, such critical measurements. However a before-and-after photograph presented in Hughes 2017 suggested the severe GBR bleaching they attributed to global warming primarily happened between February and late April. Their aerial surveys occurred between March 22 and April 17, 2016. And consistent with low tide bleaching, that is exactly the time frame that tide tables reveal reefs experienced two bouts of extreme low tides coinciding with the heat of the afternoon (March 7-11 & April 5-10). And such a combination of sun and low tide are known to be deadly. A study of a September 2005 bleaching event on Pelorous and Orpheus Islands in the central GBR by Anthony 2007, Coral Mortality Following Extreme Low Tides And High Solar Radiation, had reported extreme deadly effects when extreme low tides coincided with high solar irradiance periods around midday. As in Indonesia, they also reported bleaching and mortality had occurred despite water temperatures that were ‚Äúsignificantly lower than the threshold temperature for coral bleaching in this region (Berkelmans 2002), and therefore unlikely to represent a significant stress factor.‚Äù Along the reef crests and flats, ‚Äú40 and 75% of colonies in the major coral taxa were either bleached or suffered partial mortality. In contrast, corals at wave exposed sites were largely unaffected ( SOURCE \\nAnd the fraud goes on: 2016/2017 bleaching on GBR It seems that the 2015/2016 summer bleaching was repeated in summer this year (2016/2017). Since water levels change only slowly, that is to be expected. But note the dishonesty below. They are still attributing the bleaching to global warming -- while giving not a single number for either the global water temperature or the North Queensland water temperature. So let me supply some numbers: NASA/GISS Tell us that the global December 2016 temperature (mid-summer) was .77, which was DOWN on December 2015 (1.10)and even slightly down on 2014 (.79). So in the period at issue, there was NO global warming. So the guys below are lying through their teeth. They say that the bleaching was caused by global warming but there WAS no global warming in the period concerned. And they also don\\'t give numbers for sea levels in the area. They are zealously hiding the real cause of the bleaching BACK-to-back bleaching is killing huge tracts of the Great Barrier Reef, with almost none of the coral effected in 2016 expected to recover. Recent aerial surveys by the Australian Research Council‚Äôs Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies have revealed only the southern third of the reef is unscathed from the bleaching events. Researcher Terry Hughes said mass bleaching happened in 2017 even without the assistance of El Nino, which normally brings warmer sea surface temperatures. ‚ÄúThe bleaching is caused by record-breaking temperatures driven by global warming,‚Äù Professor Hughes said. ‚ÄúUltimately, we need to cut carbon emissions, and the window to do so is rapidly closing.‚Äù Warmer water temperatures cause coral to expel their algae, turning them bright fluorescent colours and eventually bone white. Marine biologist James Kerry said bleached corals were not necessarily dead but it was anticipated high levels of coral would be lost in the central region of the reef, which experienced the most intense bleaching this year. ‚ÄúIt takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals, so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016,‚Äù Dr Kelly said. Tropical Cyclone Debbie also destroyed parts of the reef around the Whitsundays, a popular tourist destination that had largely escaped the worst of the bleaching so far. While cyclones normally cause the water temperature to drop, Prof Hughes said any cooling effects were likely to be negligible in relation to the damage caused by the slow-moving Category 4 system. ‚ÄúClearly the reef is struggling with multiple impacts,‚Äù he said. The Great Barrier Reef is known to have experienced four bleaching events in 1998, 2002, 2016 and 2017.

Top officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations gathered in Rome, Italy today amid growing concerns over the US administration\\'s moves to unravel policies aimed at stalling global warming. Environmental activists fear US President Donald Trump is dismantling Barack Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan, which aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants. Greenpeace was holding a sit-in outside Monday\\'s meeting, calling on officials to maintain their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, the US \\'reserved its position\\' on the text about commitments made by G7 countries under the Paris accord, said Carlo Calenda, the Italian minister for economic development, who chaired the meeting in Rome. The ministers\\' agenda had called for discussion of energy security, policies to move away from coal, natural gas routes and supply, sustainable development of electricity sources, alternative fuel scenarios and energy access and investments in Africa. Lacking unanimity, Italy, which currently presides the Group of Seven, decided against proposing the joint statement, Calenda said. The Paris Agreement, endorsed by members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a bedrock of international action against man-made global warming. It vows to cap warming to \\'well below\\' two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to late 19th-century levels - an effort that scientists say will require massive cuts in carbon emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. It also pledges to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for poor countries badly exposed to drought, flood, rising seas and other climate impacts. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back some of the previous Democratic administration\\'s policies on carbon emissions and climate change. Experts have said his plan, which eases emissions limits for coal-fired power plants and scraps more stringent vehicle pollution standards, almost guarantees that the US will fail to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Trump has also said he does not intend to honour promises made by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama, to provide financial aid under the Paris accord. However, Trump\\'s team is also deeply divided on whether to withdraw from the pact, according to US media reports. On March 30, the White House said a decision on whether to withdraw would be made ahead of the G7 summit in Italy in late May. Under Obama, the United States, the second biggest carbon polluter, provided critical impetus for the Paris deal by concluding a precursor deal with China, the number one emitter. The Group of Seven, gathering the biggest western democracies, comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. SOURCE \\nLawmakers Should Invoke the Nuclear (Reprocessing) Option When President Jimmy Carter issued a federal ban on the reprocessing of nuclear waste in 1977, he thought it was a sensible trade-off that erred on the side of public safety. In hindsight, however, it was an abysmally bad move. While many politicians continue to demonize atomic energy, France has shown that nuclear waste processing can safely yield major benefits: It has enabled that country to sell billions of euros in electricity to other countries each year. It‚Äôs an instructive example that the United States should follow, according to Independent Institute Senior Fellow William F. Shughart II. ‚ÄúReprocessing both reduces nuclear waste significantly and lowers the cost of nuclear-generated power,‚Äù Shughart writes in the Salt Lake City Tribune. Nuclear waste reprocessing reduces but does not eliminate the need for a deep-storage site. Lawmakers should therefore get the $32 billion Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility back on track for completion, after former Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) unplugged it. ‚ÄúImplementing reprocess and finishing a waste repository take time,‚Äù Shughart writes, ‚Äúbut spent nuclear fuel is a commodity too precious to waste.‚Äù SOURCE \\nManual Provides Eco-Terrorism Tips on How to \\'Make Someone\\'s Life Hell\\' A new eco-terrorism manual has been published and is being sold online by Earth First!

See here or here 11 April, 2017 The flawed thinking at the heart of the renewable energy swindle Bjorn Lomborg A new report revealing that using wood pellets to generate electricity can actually speed up global warming should be the final nail in the coffin for the flawed policy of biomass subsidies. Policies designed to incentivise green energy use are not only having a dubious effect on climate change, they are destroying biodiversity and even killing many thousands of people. Wood (or to use the technical term covering wood, wood pellets and other burning matter like animal dung, biomass) is by far the most significant renewable energy source. In both the US and the EU, biomass is the single largest source of renewable energy. Owing to poverty, around three billion people globally cook and heat their homes with wood, twigs and dung. More than four million die prematurely each year because of the resulting indoor air pollution. And yet, in rich nations we have the bizarre notion that burning biomass is ‚Äògreen‚Äô and eco-friendly. Governments, including in Britain, have deliberately promoted greater biomass dependence. The Drax power station in North Yorkshire generates seven per cent of the U.K‚Äôs electricity, predominantly burning biomass, supported by government subsidies. Seventy per cent of the electricity produced ‚Äì enough to power Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool ‚Äì is made using compressed wood pellets felled in the US and imported by ship. But a new report from Chatham House suggests that this policy is very problematic when it comes to its goal of cutting CO2. It finds that the government‚Äôs view of biomass as a carbon neutral energy source is a ‚Äòflawed assumption‚Äô that is based on ignoring the emissions from the burning of wood. The problem is that the European Union policy holds the fictitious position that biomass produces no CO2 whatsoever. ‚ÄòEmissions from the fuel in use shall be taken to be zero‚Äô, says a 2009 directive. New Scientist rightly calls this assumption a ‚Äòscam‚Äô. The assumption underpins the EU‚Äôs 2020 renewables goal and its ‚Ç¨8 billion (¬£6.84bn) annual spend on biomass ‚Äì which has led to reports of protected forests being cut down in places like Italy and Slovakia. The EU now gets 65 per cent of its renewable energy from biomass. The effects on biodiversity of this practice are also troubling. Environmentalists point out that some manufacturers harvest whole trees ‚Äî including hardwoods from bottomland areas ‚Äî that can take a long time to regrow. A European Commission report found that the policy risks from transatlantic wood energy trade include ‚Äòbiodiversity loss, deforestation and forest degradation‚Äô in the U.S. The increase in biomass goes far beyond power stations, and reaches into our own homes. Policy-makers are using subsidies and tax policies to make fossil fuel-based energy more expensive and wood and pellets cheaper. Northeastern US states have seen 50 per cent to 150 per cent increases in wood as the main heating source since 2005. The UK is using financial incentives to ensure 700,000 homes convert to biomass heating, and biomass boilers are increasingly being installed to meet renewable energy requirements. As we have seen on a vast scale in the developing world, burning biomass is far from benign. Even in the rich world, burning wood ‚Äì encouraged by rising energy costs from green policies ‚Äì is becoming a leading cause of death. In Prague, 27 per cent of the dangerous air pollution in winter today comes from wood smoke; in southern Germany it can reach 59 per cent. In London, it constitutes more than ten per cent. Outdoor air pollution is the biggest environmental challenge in the rich world. Smoke from wood fires now constitutes 10-30 per cent of the total outdoor air pollution in Europe, meaning it conservatively claims 40,000 lives each year, and possibly many more. These are deaths from renewable energy. To put this into perspective, 26,000 people die each year in traffic accidents in the EU. It will get worse. It is estimated that in Europe, small-scale domestic wood and biomass combustion will become the dominant source of the most dangerous particulate air pollution by 2020. In other words, it will be a bigger source of killer pollution than cars or industry and much bigger than power generation. During the Paris climate summit, former Californian Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger claimed that fossil fuels cause 19,000 deaths each day. He was far off. Around 3,900 deaths every 24 hours can be attributed to fossil fuels, whereas 11,000 deaths daily are caused by our reliance on biomass. The problem comes from a governmental desire to transition to renewables before they are ready. We use biomass to cover for inefficient solar and wind, which need backup power when it isn‚Äôt windy or sunny. We will only solve global warming when solar and wind can compete with fossil fuels on their own merits. To achieve that, huge investment in green energy R&D, including batteries, is needed. But in the meantime, biomass is a terrible short-term answer to global warming. In incentivising its use, policy-makers are having a dubious effect on climate change, likely destroying biodiversity, and killing tens of thousands from air pollution. SOURCE \\nEnergy policy will be about cutting costs, not emissions, says British government chief The Government‚Äôs energy policy will focus on cutting costs to business as a Whitehall official admits it has ‚Äòneglected industry for too long‚Äô. Peter McCusker reports. UK energy policy has been view through the prism of the ‚Äòtrilemma‚Äô since Ed Miliband‚Äôs 2008 Climate Change Act, but that is changing under Theresa May‚Äôs Government. Nigel Pargiter, acting head of energy supply chains at BEIS (Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy), told a North East audience that the emphasis is now on cutting energy costs to homes and businesses. In a question and answer session at the annual NOF Energy Conference at the Sage Gateshead, he conceded the Government had ‚Äòneglected industry for a few decades‚Äô. Responding to a question from John Bruijnooge, site director at Teesside industrial giant Sabic, he said Whitehall ‚Äòhas had to take a long hard look in the mirror‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe have neglected industry for too long and we now have to have a keen focus on costs.‚Äù He went to say the previous energy policies, which focused on balancing a trilemma of reducing energy emissions, cutting costs and delivering energy security, ‚Äòhad been the result of tensions‚Äô between two Government departments. He said: ‚ÄúUnder the Coalition, energy policy was split between two different departments, the Department for Business and DECC (Department of Energy and Climate Change), and there were tensions. ‚ÄúWe got stuck on the trilemma. This became a sticking point, there was not one department to think holistically and this resulted in tension. ‚ÄúOur view now is that decarbonisation has a cost to domestic users and businesses and our focus now is on ‚Äòhow much can industry bear before it is too much, and decides to go elsewhere?‚Äô‚Äù In his earlier address to the conference he said: ‚ÄúThe key challenge for us all is how do we get costs down and away from the subsidy regime. This is the biggest challenge we face and one that can be tackled by Government and industry working together.‚Äù The North East has experienced the pain caused by measures to cut emissions with the introduction of the Carbon Price Floor in 2012 increasing costs at the Alcan aluminium plant by ¬£30m, leading to its subsequent closure with the loss of over 500 jobs. Mr Pargiter‚Äôs address echoed the Government‚Äôs Industrial Strategy Green Paper which talks about 10 key pillars for the UK economy; one of which is affordable energy and clean growth. In this document the Government says it will continue to pursue a clean energy vision and is expected to confirm its latest Emissions Reductions Plan within the next few months. Mr Pargiter said the Industrial Strategy will see Government ‚Äòworking with the devolved administrations and across all departments of Government‚Äô. ‚ÄúThe Industrial strategy is for the whole of the UK not just for London or specific sectors. ‚ÄúWe are trying to create networks and the right framework for business to grow and thrive, to deliver an economy that works for everyone, whilst also increasing productivity.‚Äù He said the UK is good at research and development but often not so good at commercialisation of this knowledge. He said there will be an emphasis on deregulation and supporting exporters. He went on to say there will be money available in a sector deal for energy and this will be focused on three things; energy costs, secondly to cut subsidies to zero and the third focus will be on innovation. In working with business he said the Government ‚Äòwill favour an open door approach‚Äô and businesses should ‚Äòcome forward and tell us what are the issues they face, that are hampering growth‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe want them to demonstrate a compelling case as to why they should benefit, one where it would be stupid for the Government not to get involved.‚Äù Under the Coalition the industrial strategy for offshore wind said the Government would aim for a UK capital expenditure of 70%. The average has been less than 30% and Mr Pargiter would not be drawn on the Government‚Äôs ambitions, although BEIS has previously told Journal Energy it is aiming for 50% lifetime UK content. This a thorny issue for many who work in the sector, and has been cited as one of the reasons Newcastle offshore fabricators OGN went out of business, cancelling a ¬£50m North East investment after losing out to Spanish-Government backed competitors for UK bill-payer subsidised contracts. Mr Pargiter said: ‚ÄúWe want to make sure UK companies are best placed and can operate on a level playing field. ‚ÄúWe are aiming up to open up the supply chain and more work needs to be done, there will be no percentage, but we are aiming to secure higher value contracts, not just ones for sandwiches and buses.‚Äù This emphasis on cutting energy costs comes as further evidence of the UK direction of travel on energy has emerged in the last few weeks. In the Budget Chancellor Philip Hammond said he will do all he can to prolong the life of the North Sea oil and gas industry. Mr Hammond said he would look to resolve the tax issues slowing down asset transfers, with the current tax treatment of decommissioning making it harder for existing owners to sell mature assets. Proposals could include making it easier to allow the transfer of tax history between buyer and seller. Solar supporters who hoped the Budget would cancel a projected tax on companies with rooftop solar panels were left disappointed, and this fits in with the decision to end subsidies for what are deemed to be ‚Äòestablished‚Äô renewable technologies. Last week the Government announced further support of what it calls ‚Äònon-established‚Äô renewable technologies such as geo-thermal and wave and tide, as well as offshore wind and biomass in its new Contract for Difference subsidy auction next month. SOURCE \\nNo Such Thing as a Conservative Carbon-Dioxide Tax Plan Carbon-Dioxide Tax Would Make Everything More Expensive For Working Americans Without Guaranteed Environmental Benefits A group calling itself the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) has issued a report that makes the case for a ‚Äúsensible‚Äù carbon-dioxide tax, which it says would start at $40 per ton. Also included is a scheme to distribute revenues from this tax to American families via a dividend, border carbon adjustments on imports and exports, and a significant rollback of existing regulations of greenhouse-gas emissions. CLC says the ‚Äúevidence climate change is growing too strong to ignore,‚Äù and the ‚Äúrisks associated with future warming are too big and should be hedged.‚Äù According to CLC, a carbon tax would provide an ideal ‚Äúinsurance policy.‚Äù CLC says the tax would efficiently reduce carbon dioxide, encourage technological innovation, and shrink the size of government. Additionally, the ‚Äúbottom 70% of Americans would come out ahead under such a program.‚Äù Despite these grand claims, carbon-dioxide taxes are inherently regressive and disproportionally harm low-income families. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found a $28-per-ton carbon tax, much smaller than CLC‚Äôs $40-per-ton tax, would result in energy costs being 250 percent higher for the poorest one-fifth of households than the richest one-fifth of households. CBO reports the reason for cost discrepancy is ‚Äúa carbon tax would increase the prices of fossil fuels in direct proportion to their carbon content. Higher fuel prices, in turn, would raise production costs and ultimately drive up prices for goods and services throughout the economy ‚Ä¶ Low-income households spend a larger share of their income on goods and services whose prices would increase the most, such as electricity and transportation.‚Äù As my colleague H. Sterling Burnett has noted, CLC‚Äôs $40-per-ton tax would be even more burdensome than the Obama administration‚Äôs calculation for the estimated social cost of carbon dioxide, which it determined to be $36 per ton. ‚ÄúIn other words, these old guard Republicans want to impose a tax on carbon that cost more than the costs carbon dioxide are supposed to impose on society,‚Äù Burnett said. ‚ÄúVirtually all of the CLC assertions in support of its proposal are incorrect or implausible,‚Äù wrote the American Enterprise Institute‚Äôs Benjamin Zycher, who also said the study is ‚Äúpoor conceptually and deeply unserious.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe CLC provides no evidence that climate risks are ‚Äòtoo big‚Äô and assumes that the proposed tax would provide ‚Äòinsurance‚Äô without examining the future climate effects of its proposal,‚Äù Zycher wrote. ‚ÄúThe argument that an emissions tax is a more efficient method of reducing emissions relative to regulations is not correct. The dividend proposal is naive in that it ignores the coalition problem in Congress and the relative influence of concentrated and unconcentrated pressure groups. The border tax adjustment would be hugely complex given the international supply-chain system, leading to an increase in the attendant bureaucracy even if the regulatory bureaucracy is reduced in size. ‚Ä¶ Contrary to its assertions, the CLC proposal would increase the government allocation of resources and thus the size of government.‚Äù Another problem with a carbon-dioxide tax is any environmental benefits that it might produce would be effectively meaningless without concomitant legislation enacted throughout the rest of the globe. Oren Cass, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, says the environmental benefits that might come from passage of a carbon-dioxide tax would be minimal. ‚ÄúThe effectiveness of a carbon tax as a matter of environmental policy [depends] not only on how it would directly alter the trajectory of [local] emissions but also on its ability to affect global emissions by driving globally applicable technological innovation or by influencing the behavior of foreign governments,‚Äù wrote Cass. ‚ÄúOn each of these dimensions, the carbon tax fails.‚Äù It is likely for these reasons the U.S. public finds the idea of a carbon tax so unpopular. A September 2016 poll conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed 71 percent of respondents said they were unwilling to pay an extra $20 month on their electric bills to combat climate change, although this amount is ‚Äúroughly equivalent to what the federal government estimates the damages from climate change would be on each household.‚Äù Further, almost half the respondents, 42 percent, said they would be unwilling to pay even one extra dollar. A carbon-dioxide tax would make everything more expensive for working Americans, leaving them less to spend and save without any guaranteed environmental benefits. Lawmakers would be doing their constituents a favor by not pursuing such destructive proposals. SOURCE \\nThe irrelevance to Africa of global warming talk \"People aren\\'t interested in rainfall projections for the next 100 years - they want to understand what\\'s happening to them now‚Äù More than 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within six months, the U.N. World Food Programme warned several weeks ago. Persistent armed conflict and prolonged droughts have crippled the economies of Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen and northern Nigeria, where communities are suffering the worst hunger. That means we need to change the way we look at climate risk, Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, told a meeting in Nairobi this week. Experts at the gathering called for the U.N.‚Äôs climate science panel to change the way it works, and examine how climate risk plays out locally and interlinks with other factors like the economy and health ‚ÄúRising levels of food insecurity are not just due to a lack of rainfall, but also because people are vulnerable to conflict,‚Äù van Aalst told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Kenya. ‚ÄúClimate is only one piece of a much bigger puzzle.‚Äù He urged scientists and policy makers to focus on what matters to people in highly vulnerable places. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt interested in rainfall projections for the next 100 years - they want to understand what is happening to them now,‚Äù he told the event convened by the Climate Centre and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Debra Roberts, chief resilience officer for the South African city of Durban and co-chair of an IPCC working group on climate adaptation and vulnerability, sees a growing gap between local climate action and the scientific work of the U.N. panel. ‚ÄúMost of the time, our assessment just doesn‚Äôt find its way down to the communities who need it most,‚Äù she said. Van Aalst said knowledge needs to be organised ‚Äúin a way that is helpful to people and allows them to make better decisions‚Äù. Roberts called for a ‚Äúvalue chain of actors to take these messages down so they can be refined and interpreted in the local context‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink of the IPCC as a stone we throw into a pond: What other organisations form the ripples?‚Äù International NGOs, for example, can play a role as intermediaries between governments and the population, she added. But the exchange of information must be two-way, she emphasised, with knowledge also being passed upwards by those working on the ground. Ultimately it is local people who must manage climate risks - and they can help fill gaps in understanding as well as map out solutions, said van Aalst. The Paris climate change agreement acknowledges its vision to curb global warming cannot not be achieved by national governments alone, he noted, but requires a ‚Äúclimate action agenda‚Äù, bringing in local governments, NGOs, businesses and individuals. Roberts underlined the need for a better understanding of local contexts, both in rural areas and cities. In Durban, for example, the poorest and most vulnerable residents live far from jobs and services, and are particularly exposed to environmental degradation such as worsening coastal erosion and water shortages. ‚ÄúThat is something policymakers cannot ignore when designing urban policies and trying to tackle climate risk,‚Äù she said. Cities ‚Äì which are responsible for an estimated three-quarters of planet-warming emissions, according to the U.N. Environment Programme ‚Äì are key to bridging the gap between local climate risk and global policy decisions, she said. But making that happen will take time, she added, not least because local communities tend to see themselves as recipients of expert knowledge rather than as ‚Äúgenerators of knowledge themselves‚Äù. SOURCE \\nTime for Australians to invest in emergency power, as coal-fired power stations shut down with no replacements Robert Gottliebsen All businesses and households in Victoria, NSW and South Australia need to seriously consider investing substantial sums in diesel generators, batteries or other sources of emergency power. Banks need to be ready to fund the massive investment required during the next nine months. It is now absolutely clear that each of the state governments have not invested in sufficient emergency power to back their wind and solar installations and now have a network of wires that is unsuitable for the power generation grid they have established. And the Commonwealth promises a partial solution in two or three years via the Snowy but has washed its hands of the looming disaster next summer. That means that businesses and residents who need power in hot summer days are on their own. Prepare for massive food rotting and equipment (including computer) disruption for those who did not recognise the extent of the destruction of power security by three state governments. Last week I wrote a three-part series stating that NSW, Victoria and possibly South Australia face a 75 per cent chance of blackouts because their once great networked power systems had been vandalised by politicians who made the easy decisions of plonking solar and wind generators in their state but not the hard and expensive but essential decisions of investing in the grid and providing back up. It was rank irresponsibility, although decisions were made complex by the different owners of the various parts of the network and the need to earn a return on investment. Following my series, The Australian Energy Market Operator took the unprecedented step of announcing that Victoria faced an incredible 72 days of blackouts and power shortages if Hazelwood was shut this week (April 1). Businesses in Victoria from restaurants to supermarkets and offices/factories that do not respond to the combination of my warning and that of the Australian Energy Market operator have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews walks around with his proverbial fingers crossed hoping Victoria will have another cool summer. But NSW is not much better. It went very close to blackouts last summer but was saved by Victoria‚Äôs Hazelwood power station, which is set to close on April 1. Assuming Hazelwood is shut should it be Sydney or Melbourne that gets hit by the likely combined power shortages? Last summer when Sydney ran short of power Bendigo was scheduled to be blacked out to cover the NSW government‚Äôs failure to ensure adequate power for a hot summer. Bendigo residents were outraged that they should pay the price for NSW mistakes but they were lucky and kept their power. NSW made its own Hazelwood mistake three years ago by allowing the Wallerawang power station to shut (it was about two thirds the size of Hazelwood) without ensuring the necessary investments were made to ensure supply during a hot summer. The owner of Wallerawang found that for long periods during the year the station was not required so made a commercial decision. So if it‚Äôs a hot summer in 2017-18 who should be blacked out ‚Äì Sydney or Melbourne? It will actually be determined by how the grid is operating but let me hypothetically intervene. I think it fair that NSW suffer one third and Victoria two thirds of the blackouts given that the Hazelwood closure is bigger than Wallerawang The NSW and Victorian governments are also presiding over the fastest growing populations in the country, which is multiplying the effect of their vandalism. South Australia made similar gambles and was caught with blackouts last summer (partly storm related) but now says it will go alone to secure its power. Businesses in South Australia have to decide whether to punt their government‚Äôs assurances or do what the businesses in NSW and Victoria must do and invest in back-up generation and/or batteries. As I emphasised in last week‚Äôs series that it‚Äôs not a question of carbon or non-carbon energy. If governments want to go non-carbon then they must do the job properly and change the grid and have back up. Both the NSW and Victorian governments need to get hold of the world‚Äôs best engineers to see what can be done to repair their vandalism. As I understand it there are alternatives even at this late stage. Meanwhile when the lights, computers and refrigerators go down at Point Piper, Cronulla and Kooyong I suspect the Commonwealth members for those areas (Turnbull, Morrison and Frydenberg) will get a big chunk of the blame for not declaring a state of emergency and keeping Hazelwood open by giving the French owner of the station some relief on the $1 billion rehabilitation that is required. Turnbull needs to warn power users that prices must rise much further to cover the state government mistakes. Instead, he talks about lower prices.
