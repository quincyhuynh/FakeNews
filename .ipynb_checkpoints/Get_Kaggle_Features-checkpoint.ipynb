       "  'text': 'Go to Article \\nSoros paid protesters who blocked streets and created mass chaos in big cities cashed in before the election of President Trump. For the most part, when protesters blocked miles of traffic in large cities, law enforcement officers, who were also their target (thanks to another Soros-Obama effort) protected them from being unintentionally struck by vehicles on roads and highways they were blocking. Stories of people rushing to the hospital or trying to make it to work on time were circulating all over social media. Of course the mainstream media and leftist news sources were in collusion with Democrats in their efforts to threaten and shame Americans who dared to support Trump. They foolishly believed their violent and unlawful behavior would sway voters. In addition to putting people’s lives in danger, In the end, Obama and George Soros’ thugs turned a lot of people away from the polls, as many Democrat and independent voters didn’t want to be tied to a party they no longer recognized. \\nWatch protesters yell, “Whose streets? Our streets!”: \\nJust before the midnight curfew in #CLT the crowd is at the Square chanting. Doesn’t look like they want to go home. #KeithScott \\nA post shared by David Boraks (@davidboraks) on Sep 23, 2016 at 8:56pm PDT It’s pretty safe to say if you stand in front of moving traffic, or intentionally blocking passage of a vehicle, there’s a good chance someone is going to get hurt. How do these rioters protesters know where these vehicles they’re blocking are going? What about the panicked parent who’s trying to get their kid with appendicitis to the hospital, or the cancer patient who can barely drive who’s on their way to the clinic for a treatment? Or how about the expectant mother whose anxious husband is desperately trying to navigate around a terrorists who are blocking the road as he tries to get his wife to labor and delivery? And what sort of violence or punishment by law enforcement should these innocent drivers expect if they disobey these thugs and drive through their human roadblock? \\nWatch anti-Trump Antifa terrorists take over major streets in DC chanting “Our streets!” \\nNC lawmakers are taking action to protect innocent drivers who encounter protesters who think jumping in front of traffic is a great way to protest. And oh yeah …they’re not your streets…the streets belong to all Americans. \\nWFAE – Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. The North Carolina House has passed a bill that is sure to bring controversy. \\nThis measure shields drivers who hit protesters from lawsuits. \\nLast year, in the wake of the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, protesters took over Charlotte city streets, even marching down sections of I-277 and I-85. \\nThe often chanted “Who’s street? Our street!” \\nAll this caught the attention of Republican Representative Justin Burr of Montgomery County. “As we’ve seen, time and time again, as folks run out in the middle of the streets and the interstates in Charlotte and attempt to block traffic,” Burr said as he introduced the bill. He wants to ensure “drivers don’t have to fear driving through Charlotte or anywhere in North Carolina.” \\nNow there are many ways this could be done. \\nBut Burr decided to go in a controversial direction with House Bill 330 . \\nHe explains the bill this way, “provides that a person driving an automobile while exercising due care is immune for civil liability for any injury to another if the injured person was participating in a demonstration or protest and blocking traffic.” \\nTranslation: a driver who hits, or even runs over, a protester on a street could be shielded from lawsuits by the person they injure. \\nBut Burr wanted to be clear on one point. “Now this bill does not allow for a driver of a vehicle to target protesters intentionally. That obviously is not the intention.” \\nWatch what happens here when protesters block a car that is on its way to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital with a sick child: \\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com \\nIn other words, if you were trying to get from point A to point B and you just happen to hit a protester, or more, while driving through a demonstration, you would be protected from civil lawsuits. \\n“We all know this is being done to try to make a point about protests,” said Democrat Greg Meyer. He’s just one of the lawmakers who saw a problem with this bill. “It is just going to embarrass us. There is no good reason to pass this bill.” \\nThe bill has passed the North Carolina House. It now heads to the Senate. Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!',\n",

The sign below says: “SMASH THE STATE…AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT” \\nAntifa just can’t help but be violent – they have proven to be total thugs! They even sell knives on their website! They were successful in threatening the city of Portland until they shut down a traditional parade: \\nPORTLAND ANTIFA SHUTS DOWN TRADITIONAL PARADE: \\nThe irony in this entire cancellation of a tradition in Portland, Oregon is that now the Antifa (Anti Fascists) have pissed off the more moderate lefties. One group was going to speak at the parade event against white supremacy but now they won’t get the chance. It’s turning out that the Antifa group is more violent than any other radical group we’ve known. They’re even selling knives on their website! \\n\\nA threatening email has derailed one of the Portland Rose Festival’s signature events, and spurred new debate about the ongoing political protests in Portland. \\nOrganizers of the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade announced Tuesday that the event will be canceled, for fear that the east Portland parade could be disrupted by “the type of riots which happen in downtown Portland.” (see video below) \\nOriginally scheduled this Saturday, April 29, the parade is meant to highlight the local community and businesses along Southeast 82nd Avenue, aiming to turn around the negative perception many people have of the area. It started in 2007 and has since become a popular event on the Rose Festival calendar. \\nThis year’s parade was once again set to feature the Multnomah County Republican Party as one of the many groups slated to march, but that inclusion drew ire from some of the city’s left-leaning protest groups. \\nAt least two protests were planned for the day of the parade, one by Oregon Students Empowered and another by Direct Action Alliance. Both events were mentioned in an email sent to parade organizers on Saturday, threatening to shut down the event with hundreds of protesters in the street. \\n“You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,” the anonymous email said, telling organizers they could cancel the Republican group’s registration or else face action from protesters. “This is non-negotiable.” \\nThe parade is organized by the 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association, a part of the neighborhood business organization Venture Portland. Representatives from neither organization returned calls for comment. \\nThe cancelation isn’t necessarily a win for the protest groups. Jacob Bureros, an organizer with the Direct Action Alliance, said the organization – which intended to speak out against fascism and white supremacy during the parade – is sad to hear the news. \\n“We are disappointed that the parade was canceled,” he said. “We’re members of this community and this is an awesome parade.” \\nJames Buchal, chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, said his group was ready to march despite the protesters. He said the party had no hand in cancelling the event, and was taken by surprise when they heard the news. After seeing the email last weekend, they had no plans to back out. \\n“We weren’t willing to just walk away quietly,” he said. “The next thing we knew the whole thing was canceled.” \\nThe problem is the police said they couldn’t offer additional security for the parade so the organizers backed out. We know the Portland Police Department can move to stop this type of activity. \\nCheck out this recent shut down of protesters blocking a bus in downtown Portland: \\nPortland protesters were doing the usual idiotic tactic of blocking the street and not letting traffic proceed…What they didn’t realize is that the police aren’t taking this anymore…Watch the takedown of these punks…Awesome! \\nCheck out the lady with the thumbs up!

       "  'text': 'Go to Article \\nLaura Ingraham is dialed in on the Republican’s inability to get a good budget bill. She held up the Washington Post to show how Pelosi and Schumer are celebrating the victory of the budget. The Democrats got pretty much everything they wanted at the expense of the American people. \\n“We do not have a Republican Party on Capitol Hill that can get its act together.” – Laura Ingraham \\nLet’s face it…the Republicans didn’t fight for us and Ingraham knows it. She mentions key parts of the spending bill in her rant on Fox & Friends. We’re happy she mentioned the ***Refugee Resettlement Program because that’s one part of the bill that we’re very disappointed in. The Refugee Resettlement Program is so bloated and needs to be overhauled or defunded altogether. We’re sick about it: \\nThe bill would include a total of $3 billion towards migration and refugee assistance, which is roughly the same that was spent in Fiscal Year 2016. It would also include $50 million towards the emergency refugee and migration assistance fund, which is also the same amount spent in the previous fiscal year. Via: Daily Caller',\n",
