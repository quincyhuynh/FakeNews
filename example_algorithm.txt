bayesian classifier:

count words appearing in happy set
and do same for sad set

get different distributions for happy and sad

given input sentence, what is probability of words in sentence being happy and prob of being sad 
	-> compare sentiments and classify sentiment


To DoL
randomly sort data/preprocess data -> write to csv for speed
map data/features to news type [2 if fake, 1 if bs, hate, bias, 0 else]
do feature extraction [countvectorizer]
do forest classify/logistical regression
cross validate [train on 75% test on 25%]
put in regular python file -> compile?
